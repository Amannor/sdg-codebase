With the rise of food insecurity and the organic movement, much of society is showing an interest in localizing food production. However, many consumers do not have the space or time for a garden, despite the desire to supplement food they buy with food they grow. This increased focus on sustainability is also leading to a reexamination of our current agriculture systems. Alternative forms of agriculture like aquaponics and hydroponics are more sustainable than traditional farming, but do not yet boast mainstream success. When it comes to adopting new technology, educational institutions are vital for encouraging this adoption and inspiring the next generation of innovators.

Because of this, the design and construction of buildings have a significant effect on the probabilities of meeting the 2°C target. AsaDuru enables African property developers to create self-sufficient housing communities using rammed earth construction, delivered through an exclusive partnership with the market-leading company Earth Structures Group. Their proprietary formworks allows us to build rammed earth walls, as subcontractors using local and sustainable materials, significantly faster than the closest competitor, while developing our own IP. Rammed earth is one of the most sustainable wall building techniques available (BREEAM A+) with low embodied energy (70% less than fired bricks) and a high thermal mass. Local soil is packed layer by layer within a formwork to create durable, load-bearing walls. In certain markets, such as Kenya, our rammed earth system is already significantly cheaper than the cheapest alternatives (concrete blocks & bricks). AsaDuru will build on this foundation by including solutions that allow a holistic approach to building, including wastewater treatment, rainwater harvesting and renewable energy. Combined, these elements will build homes which produce their own water and energy and deal with their own waste. This is a concept we are calling NZero.

1184,mitti cool,https://mitticool.com/,Rainmaking,"the mitti cool refrigerator is made of natural clay and runs without electricity, serving as an affordable cooling alternative for rural communities in developing countries. this solution is a non-electric refrigerator that is cooled only through evaporation of water. the upper chamber of the mitti cool refrigerator is used for storing water that slowly drips down the sides of the refrigerator unit and evaporates. this evaporation draws energy from the surroundings to produce a considerable cooling effect, removing heat from the inside storage chambers and leaving them cool. using only water, it is possible to keep food, vegetables and milk naturally fresh for days. the refrigerator is made of white clay and has a simple design that eliminates the need for regular maintenance. in areas with electricity shortages and frequent blackouts, the mitti cool refrigerator offers a reliable cooling storage option. why you should care according to the un food and agriculture organization, much of the post-harvest loss of fruits and vegetables in developing countries is due to the lack of proper storage and refrigeration facilities. this is partly because refrigeration can be expensive to buy and run. mitti cool addresses these challenges by offering a low-cost alternative that is simple and does not require any external power supply. this makes the solution viable in rural areas with poor electricity infrastructure.",india,2,People,2.3 Postharvest Food Preservation,clay fridge cools through evaporation,India

El objetivo fundamental es el de crear innovación a través del desarrollo Software. Por eso, hemos detectado varios problemas de hoy en día en el centro de Madrid (y en otras grandes ciudades) y hemos comenzado a desarrollar una primera solución para ayudar a resolver este reto. En el sitio web: https://movildrive.com/soluciones.html planteamos nuestra primera solución básica para PYMES y Autónomos para Android / iOS. Se trata de un Car-Sharing eléctrico con vehículos grandes para trabajadores de PYMES y Autónomos y tambíen para particulares. El modelo de negocio está basado en un Car-Sharing, muy extendido en los últimos años, que se podría segmentar entre particulares y empresas. El mercado está validado por diversos estudios y conocidas firmas de consultoría y muestra oportunidad de negocio hasta 2030 debido a las nuevas leyes sobre contaminación CO2 y las normativas europeas para fabricar vehículos eléctricos de todas las marcas :) Aún no existe una solución de Van-Sharing para pequeños empresarios y autónomos que tienen que hacer sus repartos o realizar sus servicios cada diario en el centro de Madrid y Barcelona, y esto les crea un problema a la hora de moverse, encontrar aparcamiento y acceso al centro. Además de las multas que estos pequeños empresarios tienen que pagar por trabajar que hace que las performance de sus negocios y sus ganancias se vean afectadas, repercutiendo directamente al bolsillo de los responsables del negocio a final de mes. Por eso planteamos esta primera solución, para ayudar a los trabajadores de todos los sectores PYMES, y donde cubriremos usuarios profesionales, autónomos y usuarios particulares que podrán usar nuestras furgonetas eléctricas por la ciudad a diaria y los fines de semana. Una de las ventajas competitivas que ofrecemos respecto a otras empresas es la posibilidad de desarrollar una App con Inteligencia Artificial y Deep-Learning para detectar objetos urbanos y envíar notificaciones al usuario y al coche a través de alertas en su Smart-Phone. (Sector Connected-Car y Smart-City) Otro posible uso sería para aseguradores donde podríamos guardar datos de conducción del usuario (de la flota o empresa) identificando situaciones de distracción al volante y conducciones irregulares para avisar al conductor a través de alertas e indicar medidas más seguras al volante. La primera App básica ya está en Google Play y ha sido desarrollada por el fundador junto con dos becarios de programación, y en un tiempo record hemos integrado una solución completa de car-sharing, con monitoreo y tracking de vehículos en Tiempo Real. El primer vehículo Movildrive también está ya disponible y tiene más de 10 usuario en menos de 1 mes: https://movildrive.com/comofunciona.html En adelante queremos ampliar nuestro equipo para traer con nosotros a desarrolladores de Java y de iOS que tengan experiencia en Machine Learning, además de un técnico de Márketing y SEO para llevar a cabo nuestras primeras campañas de márketing online y publicidad. Aunque nuestro primer Movildrive es una Berlingo Eléctrica, dejaremos al inversor que elija el modelo de furgón eléctrico en el que quiere invertir (Nissan NV200, Peugeot Partner Eléctrica, Kangoo ZE, etc) Nuestro Pitch-Deck para el primer MVP en fase Seed cuenta únicamente con los gastos de estos desarrolladores que se incorporen para ayudar al desarrollo de las App más avanzadas, y la primera flota de 10 vehículos. Las primeras figuras KPI de Julio 2018 aseguran la rentabilidad del negocio, y aunque aún es muy pronto para hacer un analisis finaciero, establece un retorno de la inversión mínimo del 50% sin haber hecho ninguna campaña de marketing ni de publicidad en estos momentos. Al Break-Even o Punto de Equilibrio se llegaría en menos de tres años, ofreciendo rentabilidad a partir del primer día, y desde ese momento solo ganancia, con vehículos eléctricos con poco mantenimiento y tan solo un recambio de las baterías entre los 5-7 años. El Plan de Negocio ha sido realizado para un equipo de 5px y con flotas de 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 y 300+ vehículos eléctricos y se han analizado todos los escenarios posibles con cifras reales.

Politicians and corporations are a heavy and slow machinery. The latest driven only by profit. People know this, and they are tired of waiting for solutions, people want to participate and take action. But they are also busy and often too worried about their own issues as per investing their time on planting a tree or riding a bicycle instead of driving their car. Fortunately nowadays technology is accesible for everyone. There are specialized Apps that helps us in every task we can imagine. We look at the weather forecast, consult the stock markets, book hotels, reserve taxis, present boarding passes at the airport, read digital newspapers and will end up connecting online with our doctor. Our smartphone is often the last thing we see before felling asleep and we use it as our clock alarm in the morning. However, how many of us is using its smartphone or tablet to create a better world? Which APP is out there that allows you to become an environmental hero? What is the Company that allows you to plant a forest, to become carbon neutral, to measure your impact in the environment, that reinforces you when you do something positive, that brings you environmental awareness, that even makes your ego grow when you share your heroic acts on social media, that encourages you to actually do it all, but even better: DOES IT FOR YOU! Well, Reforestum is all of it and much more. Reforestum offers a green hub for each individual and company that cares about the planet and the future of humanity, that is aware of the risk we are taking if we don’t come all together against climate change.

Each time anyone makes use of a taxi ride, a Uber, a flight, a hotel, a car sharing service, electricity, vacations, clothes, document shipping, online shopping… it´s all digital, and we want to connect and funnel it all towards our APP. Let´s talk about an ideal scenario: You take a taxi from Schuman to Zaventen Airport, at the end of your trip the App provides you with a exact calculation: the vehicle has polluted 0,5 Kg of CO2 and then offers you to offset your carbon footprint for a few cents of Euro. If you agree the App will extend the forest that you already own in the north of Belgium in a small fraction. Imagine now that you do the same thing many times during the year, and that at the end of that year the outcome is that you owe rights over 200 sqm of forest, a forest that you can actually visit, that you can track online through the Reforestum App! It´s like a savings box for your grandchildren! And not only that, Reforestum is building an online communty of earth warriors with competitions, badges and more. The App will analyze your lifestlyle and give you advice in order to reduce your ecological footprint. It will congratulate you each time you are closer to neutrality maybe because you walked instead of taking a taxi, or said no to a plastic bag. Of course, the objective is that each one of us can become carbon neutral and that we can all together reforest the world! We are already in business, we have planted a first forest in Spain and have delivered a first version of the online APP.

It will be a challenge for both individual property owners and society in general. The risk is obvious that the power grid; both locally and nationally will be exposed to high loads. This leads to an increased need for investment in new electricity power supply and other infrastructure measures. - - - At the same time an increasing number of electric vehicles charged via the electricity grid will lead to a growing battery capacity for electrical energy. This new resource will also increase the potential for utilising locally produced solar electricity. The load on the grid will be reduced while the potential for new production of solar electricity increases. - Charging points will be certified for using solar electricity primarily from local or owned production. If locally produced solar energy is not available; the charging point will be supplied with solar power from other producers through issued guarantees of origin. Charging electric vehicles at a certified solar charging point can be sure to always get 100% solar. - If a solar power installation is connected directly to the charging points the vehicles can be charged with higher power when the sun is shining; which requires a straight-forward control. The self consumption can be increased and the purchased electricity reduced. With so-called forecast control the charging can also be controlled by the estimated future solar radiation. With Solarcharge Systems charging peak loads can also be avoided during high electricity prices; or when other needs must be prioritised.,Developed Markets

Jan 2018) is a Norwegian Ocean Tech company that develops innovative solutions to prevent and reduce plastic waste in the sea. Our products are designed to collect plastic waste in and below the water surface in lakes, canals, rivers and river mouths, harbors, marinas, and other waterfront areas. The problem we are working to solve Between 4,8 and 12,7 million tons of plastic ends in the oceans every year, the main problem is the release of plastic waste into the ocean through waterways, rivers, harbor areas, and other areas close to the coast. The solution is to gather the waste in the water bodies close to the polluting sources by a moving or stationary floating device with a practical and right-sized collecting and storage system. The increased focus on plastic waste in the ocean specifically, and the protection of the environment in general, leads cities and other waterway owners to search for new cleaning options. Several do this manually or with crudely adapted boats. The response from the market is that this kind of collection system – its size, focus area, operation mode, and autonomous operation mode – fits the need of many cities. Products The Clean Sea Aqua Drone is an all-electric, autonomous floating waste-collecting Aqua drone, combining robotic technology with modern and efficient design with the purpose of capturing plastic waste in the water surface, and built to be easily emptied. Providing clean waters in ports, marinas, and waterways, protecting marine habitats. Added value stream mapping and data collection The Clean Sea Flexi Pods are flexible and attractive modular floating docks with built-in autonomous waste collectors and internal collection pools, designed to keep marinas and private waterfront estates clean from floating plastic waste and thus reduce the inflow of waste into the open seas Impact Plastic waste will be collected before it is dissolved or reaches the high seas. The effect can be measured in the volume of plastic collected. We are advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG14 (Life Below Water) by contributing to reducing plastic pollution and contributing to the sustainability of the ocean - SDG6 (Clean Water Sanitation) by improving the quality and sustainability of water resources by addressing the impact of plastic waste inflow. Focus of activities Our focus of business is an area identified for maximum effectiveness; Rivers, river mouths, harbors, marinas, resorts, and waterfront urban development areas. Especially the Mediterranean region, where significant resources have been allocated to France, Spain, and Italy through the Mediterranean Action Plan. This market is estimated to increase to 10.2% by 2024, compared to 8% in 2018. Africa is another priority region where 70 million metric tons of waste are generated each year, but only 10 percent is collected. By 2025, over 160 million metric tons of waste will be generated annually, and much of it will end up in the sea due to a lack of proper waste treatment. Assumptions We believe, based on current trends that 5 years from now, every waterfront area with human activity will either have an active cleaning system for its waters or a strong push to install such a system. Where no regulations or laws exist or are effective, NGOs and other stakeholders will demand and support the installation of a system. Public demand will play a major role in resorts and other private waterfront areas.

A water sample is pumped through the filter, which collects metal ions from the liquid. The metals are concentrated up to 200 times in the filter compared to the original water sample. The high concentration of the metals in the filter makes it possible to measure them with a portable and affordable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) sensor, which on its own is not sensitive enough to measure the water samples. The original metal concentrations in water are calculated based on XRF measurements by our calibration algorithm. We offer a portable device for measuring metal content of water on-site in real time.

In 2017 we noticed that there wasn't any small wind generators in the hiking market and at the same time we got an idea for the perfect structure of a portable wind generator. We use only an aluminium tube and give them a shape of S, add some fabrik between pipes and tensioning for the whole structure. WindPal Hiker - the world's simplest wind turbine was born. During development stage it was surprisingly difficult to find any decent small generator from the market. So we had to make our own. Soon we noticed that the generator was outstanding, fully waterproof and shockproof. First we decided to use the generator (The Base) in water turbine and as we expected it worked perfectly. Because there isn't wind or current always near you, we decided to design a hand crank which fit perfectly with The Base. During winter time in northern Finland the sun is not visible for three months and contitions are overall very harsh. As passionate hikers our goal is to make power in any circumstances.

You can prevent problems and boost positive changes together with your team, but also react fast enough in the new remote working conditions. *Why is this important?* The modern work life has become stressful already before the COVID19 pandemic and the future aftermath of it. During the last decades the mental virus of exhaustion, stress and burnouts (including early retirements due to mental illnesses) has spread globally like viruses in real-life. Now facing the pandemic, people are working in new conditions and under a lot of extra stress during the pandemic. This will affect people’s mental health and wellbeing but also businesses’ and organizations’ ability to perform during the crisis and when recovering from it. According to the research by Dr. Wilmar Schaufeli,[the burnout rate in the EU was close to 10 % (https://www.wilmarschaufeli.nl/publications/Schaufeli/500.pdf) and it varied between 4,3 % (Finland) and 20,6 % (Slovenia). Not recently done, but the Last deep-dive in the EU showed that the cost of burnout and exhaustion is at least €20 billion (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336011) per year. According to another study, the cost of stress is more than €600 billion in the EU (https://www.eurocadres.eu/stress-at-work-a-cost-to-reduce/) per year. The number of burnouts and the costs associated will surely increase now in the pandemic crisis and current working conditions. We don’t yet have enough data on the impact and costs of the current crisis. HR and leadership are also facing new challenges. They have too much workload already and are failing to support the work communities. They need help in assessing the mental wellbeing issues, spotting emerging problems early on, and focusing their support and efforts on those teams and people who need it the most. But it is not only HR who needs support in this new situation. We ALL need support today and when facing the long-term effects of the pandemic. Even if you still can continue working, you have to learn new ways of organizing your work, collaborating with your team, and balancing work and family. At the same time, stress and anxiety have increased, but we all are more alone than ever before and have to tackle these issues in isolation. We need more support at work and we long for the social relationships with our friends, families, colleagues, and customers. It’s now harder to get any support from colleagues or supervisors with limited or no connection with them. This is why we want to help teams and organizations to take better care of their mental wellbeing together.",Helsinki,3,People,,,

Specifically for catering buyers, this results in keeping them trapped in a captive market with uniform and interchangeable offerings within a single supplier and across suppliers. *SOLUTION* Gastronaut is a catering company with a radical business model that scales physical assets with the same ease, speed and cost as scaling software, while also improving the value chain. Specifically, we develop and coordinate a proprietary network of independent cloud kitchens (fundamentally different from other dark-kitchen models) to produce a complex catering service for a single buyer, and a single cloud kitchen to produce simultaneously for multiple buyers. Gastronaut's model allows for: - 9x higher margins than any caterer, - 2,5x higher margins than food-mediating/aggregating platforms, - in the consumer-facing food market with the highest AOV (catering) - while offering buyers the only award-winning and premium experience at mid-range prices. *POSITIVE IMPACT* Gastronaut partners only with talented immigrant chefs who bring specialised craftsmanship and sophisticated flavours exclusively from their home countries. This enables us to create jobs, integration opportunities and economic sustainability for immigrants to achieve breadth and depth of impact.

The What Over the past 30 years we have become 40% less empathic, and over 550 million (13% of the world’s population) are suffering from mental health problems. Both of which derives from an underserved development of social and emotional skills (SEL). Global organisations such as World Economic Forum and OECD also notes that SEL is a crucial skill set in the future workforce. Research also shows that SEL can improve students’ performance by as much as 11 percentile points. The numbers are in. If children under five are equipped with SEL, they have a much better foundation for reaching their fullest potential later in life. However, there’s a lack of playful tools to do so, and an urgent need to level the playing field. As Minouche Shafik said: “In the past, jobs were about muscles, now they’re about brains, but in the future they’ll be about the heart”, which is why Peppy Pals has created “a world where hearts grow smart”. The How To give children the skills they need to reach their fullest potential, and at the same time level the playing field, we must consciously tap into every child’s social and emotional intelligence as part of the early childhood development. Peppy Pals is the first company in the world to gamify social and emotional intelligence without language. Our unique approach uses storytelling, humor and qualitative animations. Through five gender-neutral characters children explore scenarios relatable to real life that also sparks parent-child conversations. Our easy-to-use application has proven to reduce conflicts, form stronger relationships and help children talk vividly about emotions. By using a non-language method we have created a basis from which we can reach millions of children globally, including vulnerable populations and those affected by conflict, which makes us eager to continue to change lives on a much larger scale. The Why Peppy Pals was founded by Rosie Linder in 2013. With two daughters growing up in the digital era, Rosie had a dream to create high-quality games for children that were both entertaining and educational. She understood the importance of social and emotional learning and noted the difficulties with introducing and explaining more complex emotions to toddlers without playful tools that captures their attention. The idea of Peppy Pals was born. Rosie partnered with the award-winning game developers at Talawa Games and psychologist Bodil Wennberg with the aim of creating a fun, interactive app that teach children valuable lessons in emotional intelligence. In April 2014, Peppy Pals released our first app featured by world-wide by Google Play and Amazon. Since then, we have released several apps, books, a TV-serie with Viaplay and an educational tool. Our apps have been downloaded in 150 countries and the Peppy Pals brand and learnings are growing in several markets.",Sweden,"3,4,",,,,

We offer a circular solution that reuses shampoo- and shower gel containers. The What Soaps and shampoos offered in hotel rooms come in single-use plastic containers. Plastic is highly durable, slowly degrading and CO2 intensive, hence polluting our land-based environments and endangering our oceans A hotel operating with 100 guests a night can go through 109.500 single-use bottles over the course of a year. This amounts to more than 700 kilograms of plastic waste – or more than 1.4 tons of CO2 when being incinerated. These figures not only demonstrate environmental abuse, but also wasted economic opportunities. The How Flacon is an early stage start-up that is developing a circular, re-use alternative to single-use packaging. By switching from single-use to reuse we can save energy and resources, deliver better and more beautifully packaging and over time do away with the need for waste all together. We are starting our reuse-journey with a B2B service in the hotel industry. As it is now most hotels provide their customers with small plastic containers for shampoo and shower gel that are thrown away after a single (if any) use. Flacon will instead offer a reuse packaging system of collecting, cleaning, refilling and returning our flacons bio soap and shampoos for hotels. Flacon will be a mediator between hotel industry, personal care product suppliers and packaging producers and ensuring the circular reuse system between them. Strong and long-lasting partnerships with not only the end clients, but also personal care suppliers and packaging supplier is a crucial part of the business model. The Why The story of Flacon starts at a election course at CBS in social entrepreneurship in winther 2018, where the founders connected over a shared commitment to environmental change. For Flacon, year 2019 is our development and prototyping playground.

Our organisation (1) design these interventions (Inclusion Nudges), and share them with practitioners/change makers/leaders (target group), (2) collect examples, curate these (write, edit, add behavioural insights) and share them on the solution platform and in Guidebooks (collection of impact practices) to enable and empower our target group (small scale impact), (3) co-design with other organisations such as nudge units, governments, OECD (target group) as part of long-term collaboration (big scale impact). So far we have been doing 1 + 2 for free, and 3 is a new part of the organisation. We are in process of developing a new business plan and organisation to grow impact and to make revenue (several revenue streams). We have proved that Inclusion Nudges works. The Why We the founders, Lisa Kepinski and Tinna C. Nielsen, were change makers and leaders in global companies when we met in 2013. We both have a background in behavioural science and are specialist in how to create inclusive and diverse organisations. We are specialists in equality, discrimination, gender parity, community, unconscious bias, social cohesion, and in development of organisations, communities, societies. We are experts in co-design and co-development with the people and communities 'it's about'. In our work we both apply behavioural insights and design. We pioneered the Inclusion Nudges approach based on practical experiments and evidence of the impact. We decided to share with out peers in this line of work for free because we believe this is the only way we will ever be a more inclusive world that benefits all people and not just the few.To achieve the inclusiveness more people need to do what works. Inclusion Nudges works. That's why we do this and want to make more impact.",Aarhus,"8,10,11,",,,,
2086,Develop Diverse,https://www.developdiverse.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/develop-diverse-1,"The Pitch Develop Diverse has built an AI-based software solution which helps companies build diverse and inclusive workplaces by eliminating social stereotypic content across companies' communication channels. The What Develop Diverse is the world’s first software tool that automatically analyses stereotypic content for gender, age and ethnicity in texts and proposes non-stereotypic alternatives. Develop Diverse allows HR, Talent Acquisition and communication managers to make their recruitment and communication content inclusive and thus helping them reach a wider and more diverse talent pool who also shares their company’s vision and values. The How The solution the Develop Diverse Software is an AI-based software platform that promotes inclusive writing which will enable you to reach a wider and more diverse talent pool. Develop Diverse detects and colour-highlights implicitly and explicitly stereotypic language in your texts and suggests neutral alternatives in real-time. The Why Scientific studies have proven that the use of stereotypic language when writing job ads is common practice, and this clearly has a psychological effect on potential applicants. Such language makes these job ads biased towards specific demographic groups, discouraging other groups from applying and this effect can reduce the applicant pool by as much as 50%. As these stereotypes are embedded in our written and spoken language, detecting and replacing it takes much more than just a glance at a short list of words to avoid or even a weekend’s training. We work with global companies such as Amazon, Vestas and Maersk Tankers and have seen 4x increase in qualified female applicants by using the Develop Diverse software.",København,"5,8,10,",,,,

We aim to provide healthy and safe products which can ensure a life of dignity, as well as eliminating the taboo surrounding menstruation. The What (Goal 3) Firstly, if girls and women can afford to use mainly unconventional menstrual products, that can be dangerous for their health, that might lead to increase in RTIs. (Goal 4) Furthermore, girls in developing countries miss up to 5 days of education each month because lacking proper products and facilities to deal with menstruation in an healthy way. (Goal 5) Thirdly, myths and taboos around menstruation often show girls and women as inferior to the opposite gender, leading to gender inequality. (Goal 6) Also, Girls and women are affected from the lack of water and sanitation especially when experiencing menstruation. (Goal 8) Finally, female workers who don't have access to proper facilities at their workplaces are forced to do not attend work. The How We are manufacturer of Safepad, the antimicrobial reusable menstrual pad.

When in lack of proper products, facilities and education, girls and women miss school or work. We believe that if we all work to make a difference girls and women will be able to live a life of dignity without menstruation being a limit. With Safepad we believe we can ensure a safe menstruation and a healthy experience, also in countries where hygiene is still not completely developed.",Kolding,"3,4,6,",,,,

The What We are address several challenges that are faced by women and girls in North Uganda. First and foremost they have a lack of income generating opportunities though they have a rare resource in their backyard; the nilotica shea tree. As such, by combining the womens strenght and potential with the value of the Nilotica tree we are able to create income for the women and girls. By doing so we at the same time create tangible value for the nilotica trees which motivates the communities to protect the trees rather then cut them down. In addition we provide training in various topics for all of our suppliers to empower them with knowledge that they can use to shape their own lives. The How We produce Nilotica shea butter from the nuts of the Nilotica tree. This is a rare and unique, high value skin superfood. It is perfect to use pure as a moisturizing treatment or to use it as an ingredient. As such, we produce it locally in uganda and sell it across the globe. Both business to customer and business to business. The Why Semine is Danish and I am Dutch and though we didn’t know each other at the time, we both packed up our bags about 9 years ago and moved to Uganda in search of how we could be of value to the world. in 2014 we both started to use Nilotica for our skin. Soon we were hooked. It was a great moisturizer, all pure and 100% natural, more effective than any other product we had ever tried. Whenever we would travel we would give it to friends and family as a gift. They loved it too and not only because it is simply an amazing product. We learned that they also loved it because it allowed them to be part of what we were doing. It gave them the opportunity to do something good by simply using a great natural cream! That was an aha moment for us. Soon our Friday evening drinks became strategy session. Knowing how much it meant for the women who produced it.

2090,Soil Scout Oy,http://www.soilscout.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/soil-scout-oy-1,"The Pitch Soil Scout has developed and patented world's first truly wireless underground IoT sensor allowing their users to monitor critical underground conditions in real-time to make keep up the optimal growth conditions. The What The current growth in fresh water consumption is unsustainable. Based on UN report the world will only have 60% of the water it needs by 2030. Agriculture alone accounts 70% of all water consumption and Golf Courses spend 9,5 Billion litres of water in irrigation every day with up to 50% of waste. In addition the cost of water is increasing and at the same time we need to produce more and more food with existing resources. The How Soil Scout has developed a unique technology to monitor critical growth conditions in agricultural sites and other artificially irrigated lands. The solution is a small, maintenance free sensor that is buried underground and it enables continuous soil monitoring, vertical profiling and detailed dynamic view to the soil parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and salinity (EC). This solution enables the users to keep up the optimal growth conditions without having to over-irrigate their land. With this technology the users are able to achieve significant savings in water and electricity and produce more crop by optimising the soil conditions. The Why In the early 2000s our founder 19th generation farmer, Dr Johannes Tiusanen started to think, that there has to be a way to understand what is happening under the surface of the field. At that time agronomists' knew that more than 50% of the crop growth is happening underground but there wasn't any way to monitor it without interfering the growth. The first idea was to attach a soil sensor to a mobile phone and bury it but it soon became obvious that there is no coverage underground. Johannes spend almost a decade developing our patented communication technology that enables wireless data transfer from underground with superior battery lifetime.",Helsingfors,"2,11,12,",,,,

The What Affordable housing and skills development: The company’s focus is the construction industry with the aim of providing: • Affordable construction/development • Skills development in the construction industry including workplace safety and entrepreneurship. Kenya has an estimated shortage of 2 million housing units per year, causing a housing crisis. The high cost of development due to outdated construction methods and unskilled labour, coupled with expensive mortgage finance, make it nearly impossible for the majority of the population to become homeowners.

However, as one privileged to have come out of that, it is our personal duty to give back to our societies and this can only be achieved by providing the tools to the society to build itself up.

2109,Spher,http://www.spher.app,https://plusimpact.io/startups/spher,"We are tackling a problem which is one of the bigger ones in the world, females feeling scared in public, at work, at home, and online. Also that their is no community based upon females empowering and help each other to a better tomorrow. How? Well we have a grand plan, but we understand that Rome was not built on one day, so we have broken it down to smaller sprints. First we are solving the problem of females being afraid of walking home alone. Then we are going to tackle the problem of females being afraid of getting harassed on the internet ( harassed by men). Then we will turn to other female problems such as health. The first thing we will build is a community based app. In the app females will be able to notify their friends when they are going from place A to B. The friends will then be able to track them so that they get there safely. If something happens, the female will be able to notify their friends (and all other females in a given distance from where they are) that they are in danger, and thus get help asap. We will also let the females (after being verified) update the app if they see something that might be dangerous for other users. For example if the streetlight is out on a street, they will update it in the app, and then the app will then notify other females heading that way (think Waze). Last but not least, females will be able to find other females going the same way as them, or notify other females which way they are heading, so they can walk together home. On top of that we will partner up with local companies (already have several cab companies, which the girls can call from the app) which will help the females get home more safe or act as a safe zone. Later on, we will launch a Mentor mentee solution, where females can find others to talk to via tags. It can be everything from “I look for friends” to “I am battling eating disorders and i would love to find a mentor/friend who has been going through it”. Regarding the why... Well Jitte, the one who came up with the idea, has always been that person who fights for those who may not wish to fight themselves (just ask his teachers from childhood). Also as being a black person in a “white world” has made him understand the problems people might not talk about that loudly. Jitte has both friends and co-workers who have been targeted by men. Some by boyfriends, others at work, some others on their way home. One of his closest friends was assaulted on her way home. But what made him suggest doing something about it was when he was in Germany and a family friend got abused and raped. No one knew she was not at home until the day after. This made him realize that it's a huge problem that one cannot reach out when in danger or that her friends can't be sure she came home safe and sound. Jitte reached out to Marcus. And just like Jitte, Marcus has both a girlfriend and a sister that they care for. So even if the problem does not directly affect us it affects people we really care for and thus we are doing it. We then did a survey, and 92% of females have been feeling afraid while walking home alone. WHich for us fueled our ambition even more. This really proved to us that we had the chance to create a better tomorrow for a huge amount of people.",Sweden,"3,5,10,",,,,

Our business optimization tool leverage data and machine learning to help food businesses make the right decisions for improving their operations and increase profitability while reducing waste at its source. Unlike existing solutions, Savvie aims to create a business optimization tool that is highly intuitive and requires no training to use. In contrast to the closest competitors in the market, we are operating on the prevention side - helping food businesses optimize their operations while aiding them in the reduction of overproduction and waste. The background of the project is based on thorough research on waste in the food industry, mapping out current processes and assessing user needs as well as the market potential. According to Project Drawdown (2020), food waste reduction has the potential to reduce global emissions by 88 gigatons by 2050 - making it the most effective way to combat climate change. According to ReFED (2020), the biggest sources of food waste come from stakeholders at the end of the value chain - households and consumer-facing food businesses. As a result, we are targeting consumer-facing businesses as they are responsible for approximately 40% of all food waste. They also have a financial incentive in reducing what is thrown out. Forecasting is one of the major issues to be solved. Today, food businesses are forecasting predominantly based on experience and gut-feeling. Solving this problem alone has the potential to save the global food industry 22 trillion NOK each year, and the Norwegian food industry 91 billion NOK a year. Consequently, this is a significant market opportunity.",Norway,12,Prosperity,,,
2113,Symptoms,https://www.symptoms.se/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/symptoms,"Symptoms has developed a digital patient-centred system for registering, compiling, and visualizing symptoms, functions and quality of life, and sharing those data with health care providers, in order to drive value-based, person-centred and equal healthcare. Symptoms allows patients to chart all of their symptoms, functions and quality of life using scientifically validated health questionnaires, as well as charting of symptoms using a three-dimensional manikin. Symptoms presents the patient’s data to healthcare professionals in a way that improves understanding of the patient’s health priorities, thereby facilitating patient-centred care and shared decision-making. Overall, evidence suggests that up to one-fifth of health spending does not create value for the patient. With over 9% of GDP spent on health care systems across the OECD, such waste undermines the financial sustainability of our health systems, and more importantly, does not lead to better health for the patients. Almost half the population has a chronic disease, and many have two or more chronic conditions. The chronic conditions are responsible for a major part of the health care costs (in Sweden, 80-85%). We do not focus on diagnoses, but instead on symptoms, functions and quality of life. The important goal is to support patients to communicate their health in a better way. The patient should not have to use a different system for their diabetes, COPD or Depression, and try to think if e.g. their fatigue is due to one of these conditions. We need to support patients to communicate their symptoms in a better way, and give healthcare the resources to understand and help the patient. In our model, the patient owns their data, and has the opportunity to share that data with different care providers, researchers, life-science companies and quality registers, through this the same data can be useful in many different areas. Symptoms Europe AB has performed market analyses, and now have four business areas and targets: Intelligence (for academia, life science, quality registries, health care payers); Clinic (hospital clinics or health centers can provide the service to all their patients, and have the possibility to follow the group of patients); Care (for healthcare providers – improving the individual meeting with the patient) and Diary (to support and empower the patient).

2116,CabiBUS Sustainable Mobility AB,https://cabibus.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/cabibus-sustainable-mobility-ab,"CabiBUS Sustainable Mobility AB is developing a patented autonomous electric vehicle to help cities and regions solve the problems with traffic congestions and fossil fuel pollution by offering safe shared rides for on-demand, door-to-door public transit in private cabins so that most people prefer that over using a private car. Cars create 62% of the total transportation CO2-eqv. (in Sweden). A sustainable and shared mobility service with autonomous electric minibuses covering 100 km in and around each city can substantially improve the traffic and its environmental impact. Transportation research and simulations (KTH Stockholm, Lissabon) has found that such services can reduce the need for cars with up to 90%. Also, Corona has dramatically increased the problems with public transportation so cities and transportation operators must find new solutions to make shared mobility so safe and attractive, that most people choose it for the daily travels. CabiBUS has 3 doors on each side that gives direct access to 6 comfortable 1 person cabins. A rear cabin can be booked for wheelchair passenger, baby stroller or large baggage. The private cabins in CabiBUS offers privacy and full protection against infections from other passengers. Strong UV-C light destroys all microorganisms in the cabin after one passenger has departed and until CabiBUS stops again to pick up another passenger in that cabin. Other unique passenger protections, only possible with separate cabins, in case of an accident, is airbags all around each passenger and a strong framework around each cabin. All types of passengers, from young to old, can feel completely safe and comfortable when sharing rides with strangers in a minibus without driver. The cabins in CabiBUS are exchangeable so on evenings and weekends, when most people are at home and the demand for personal mobility is lower, the vehicles can be used for parcel deliveries and convenient recycle collection. The CabiBUS solution is patent protected since 2018 and until 2034. CabiBUS is a Battery Electric Vehicle, BEV, with no local emissions. It will be designed with sustainability in mind: Low weight, regenerative braking and efficient driveline for low energy consumption. Very long durability, 20-40 years. Even if the sales of electric cars are increasing in the world, it will take many years until a majority of them are fossil free. Replacing all current cars with electric cars requires huge amounts of materials for the batteries and cars, so the manufacturing will have a large impact on the environment. CabiBUS can make the transition to sustainable mobility much faster and with much less materials and investments. Autonomous cars at SAE level 4 are now developed by several global companies and will soon (2022?) be launched on the market. CabiBUS can then use that technology. The EV technology is already available on the market. By offering comfortable, efficient, low cost, convenient, door-to-door, on-demand, safe and secure mobility for everyone, CabiBUS can replace a large part of the cars in the world and greatly reduce the emissions of transportation. The development of CabiBUS started in 2010 when I saw that the self-driving technology and electric drive could make my old idea for a shared on-demand, door-to-door service both economic and environmental possible. But I also saw the problem with safety and security when sharing rides with strangers in a small vehicle without a driver, so I came up with the private cabin solution. Before I sent in a contribution to an idea contest for better public transit in 2014, I applied for a patent and it was granted in 2018. For each year I have been more and more convinced that CabiBUS is the best solution for many mobility problems in cities an regions so last year I invested in a professional design and visualization. This year I set up a company with the first goal to find financing so that I can hire a professional CEO and CTO",Sweden,"9,11,13,",,,,
2117,Worthmore,http://worthmore.io,https://plusimpact.io/startups/worthmore,"Who we are Each year in Denmark, over 2 million people upgrade their smartphones, but few have a clear idea of what to do with their previous device. Of course, they could sell it or trade it in, but today these options are primarily perceived as a hassle, a scam, or a waste of time. This results in Danes often having two or more smartphones wasting in a dusty drawer. Our mission to reduce this waste and to make the best use of their potential by providing a transparent, fair, and simple way to ensure that our old technology gets used to its fullest extent. The user can then support sustainable causes through our platform with the value of their used phones. Why do we exist? Used phones are extremely valuable. In fact, every year we estimate that at least one billion kroner worth of used phones enters the market in Denmark alone. On top of this, smartphone production has tremendous environmental and social impacts that are seldom talked about. Making best use of minerals and labour that have already been put into our phones is the least we can do. Through research, we found that most people do not sell or trade-in their devices today for various reasons. However, over 90% of people responded that they would donate the value that their used phone could be sold for, entirely or in part, to philanthropic causes so long as it was easy and transparent. Therefore, not only are the causes we support genuinely good, but they provide the motivation to awaken a large and growing market. Today there is no platform where this can easily be done. Worthmore aims to fill this gap in the market and be the platform where people and businesses can easily donate all or part of the value of their used technology to support sustainable actions we all want to see more of. What happens to the used phones? The used phones we receive are safely wiped, complying with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They then have a 92% chance to be refurbished or harvested for working components. The semi-new phones are sold in markets across the world to be loved by future user. The phones that cannot be refurbished are responsibly recycled, making sure to reuse minerals that are otherwise impactful to mine. Our values As a company, we focus heavily on integrating the Nordic values of transparency, honesty, community, and simplicity into our mission. This is not typical of our competitors in this space.

2127,Sign2Me,http://www.sign2me.eu,https://plusimpact.io/startups/sign2me,"Brian Klindrup's nephew Anders is the inspiration for starting Sign2me. Anders is disabled and can not speak but uses signs to support his limited speech. Brian does not understand the signs, and wanted to buy an app that could translate the signs - such an app was not available, so subsequently Brian decided to pursue the development of such an app, contributing to equal opportunities for communication for speech and hearing disabled, and Sign2Me was a reality. In essence Sign2Me is developing an App that can translate signlanguage using only the users smartphone. Only 2 % of the worlds population understands sign language, which makes it very difficult for deaf people to communicate with non-deaf persons. This affects both social life, but also working life. Only 38 % of deaf people have a job, compared to 67 % of non-deaf people. Additionally to that communication with authorities, schools, and institutions is dependent on availability of sign language interpreters, who needs to be booked well in advance, limiting the possibility for ad-hoc communication for the deaf. The technology in Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is now so advanced that it is possible to train a neural network to recognize sign language. Using the phone's camera, the neutral network can translate the signs into speech. It is also possible to record speech via the phone's microphone and translate the speech into sign language. The characters are displayed on the phone screen by an avatar. The translation will take place in real-time, allowing for easy and fluent communication between a deaf and a non-sign language person. The alternative today is simple gestures or written communication, which for some deaf people can also be challenging, as a large number of deaf people also has reading problems. There are two types of sign language in Denmark. One that is built around its own syntax and another with the same syntax as the Danish language. The latter is called sign Danish. Initially, Sign2Me is developing an app that can translate to and from sign Danish, as this solution is technically less complicated. The explanation is that the app with sign Danish does not have to correct for differences in syntax and grammar. Sign2Me has in collaboration with the Alexandra Institute made the necessary feasibility studies to verify the technological possibilities for the development of the described app. This was done with a preliminary analysis in 2017, a Proof-of-Concept in 2018/2019 and a prototype developed in 2019/2020. The last two have been developed with support from the Innovation Fund. At the same time, Sign2Me has conducted a user survey in the deaf community to uncover interest in the app. 86% of respondents state that they want to use an app that can translate sign language. Additionally , the same respondents stated that they will also be willing to pay for a sign language app if it cannot be allocated as an aid by the Assistive Technology Center. Further there is a significant potential in selling the solution to B2B, i.e. hotels, supermarkets, restaurants and other service providers, who are obliged to fulfill the handicap convention, and allow equal service to all regardless of disabilities.

The desalination industry is generating 73 million tonnes of CO2 emissions every year – almost twice the carbon footprint of Norway. Small- and medium sized desalination in areas without access to cheap and stable electricity are often dependent on diesel and other polluting energy sources. This gives access to fresh water a high carbon footprint and a high cost. The high electricity demand for desalination is a barrier for decarbonisation of small grids, especially in islands.

According to the World Bank, remittance flows in 2018 were more than three times the size of official development assistance and in some developing countries, incoming remittances represent more than 10 percent of GDP. IFAD and World Bank have concluded that financial literacy is fundamental to empower remittance recipients to make the most of funds received. Migrants’ families were also found to be keen to save and invest their resources, but often lack knowledge and access to options to do so. UPCorp Global aims to fill this gap with a global financial education initiative. We aim to provide solutions and support to increase the financial literacy level of remittance recipients in developing countries, while trying to bridge the gaps between remittance recipients' demands and services provided by local financial institutions.

Yet, these large firms only account for 6.3% of all architecture employers. This means that very few talented small to medium sized players are getting a chance grow and compete. How We Solve the Problem: Small Innovative Architecture Firms Deserve A Seat At The Table. We give small and medium sized architecture firms a chance to discover more projects and push out more high quality proposals more quickly using our platform.

Professional users can use our scalable platform to virtually support the commissioning and life-cycle of their entire automated solutions. The world is moving into the next phase of industry, and manufacturers face an increasing number of challenges and issues to stay competitive. Greater machine connectivity and data sharing at different levels opens up new opportunities. However, many current and older systems are limited. Manufacturers face a small number of options. End their existing machine life cycle and replace with a new one. Or recondition and retrofit. Both expensive options that disrupt production, and the entire process of planning, upgrades, commissioning, verification and validation can mean it takes days or even weeks to be back in action. The third and most cost-effective, sustainable and faster solution, is to virtually test and commission the entire life-cycle to make the physical process as seamless as possible. Simumatik represents the most complete and advanced system due to hit the market. We are at the forefront of development, providing a total emulation virtual system that integrates real-world physics and behaviors.

2187,Re:newcell,https://renewcell.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/renewcell,"We make fashion sustainable. Before a shirt is worn for the first time it has been through more steps than most customers realize. Often one producer makes the yarn, another knits or weaves it into textile fabric, and a third makes the shirt from the fabric. Now it’s ready for the customer to wear.When garments are worn out or no longer wanted some are sold second-hand or used as hand-me-downs, but the vast majority end up in landfills or are incinerated. Much too few are recycled due to the fact that cotton and viscose can’t be recycled with satisfactory quality on a large enough scale. The cycle stops, because there is a hole in the loop, a crucial part is missing. Our recycling technology dissolves used cotton and other natural fibers into a new, biodegradable raw material, Circulose pulp. It can be turned into textile fiber, be fed into the textile production cycle and meet industry specifications. This is the link that has been missing from the cycle. We have closed the loop. The way fashion is produced and consumed can finally be transformed into a never-ending loop. If the world’s population increases as expected, there will be 8.5 billion people by 2030. And as the population grows, apparel consumption grows with it. But producing even more apparel will have significant impact on water use, CO2 emissions, use of chemicals and waste disposal. It’s not sustainable. Something has to change. Our process of recycling cotton fibers and viscose fibers uses less water and chemicals, emits less CO2 and prolongs the usage of the world’s resources. More used cotton garments can be collected and the volume of garments made from our recycled, biodegradable textile fibers can increase.

The crop uses a lot of water, but many growers are in areas where there is little rainfall. It takes around 11 000 litres of unpolluted water to grow 1 kilogram of cotton. That means a single t-shirt requires as much as 2700 litres of water. We don't make our products from virgin material. Instead, Pure Waste recycles the offcuts and spinning waste from clothing and textile industries. The raw material is collected, sorted by colour and quality, and mechanically opened back into the fibre. Then we mix it with recycled polyester or viscose and spin it into new yarns. After that, the process is the same as with virgin materials except that our yarns and fabrics don’t need to be dyed as their colour comes from the textile waste. “Pure Waste” is our promise to use only materials that would otherwise go to waste.

2251,Africa Reframed,https://www.africareframed.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/africa-reframed,"Marketplace for African imagery - Powered by online learning. Africa Reframed enables customers to source authentic and fully released visual content produced by African contributors. The quality level is of international, high and consistent level since contributors have been trained and groomed through our online learning platform. We are looking for partners/investors sharing our vision of Africa Reframed as a value-driven, profitable business which strives to alter the global community’s perception of the African continent while also building sustainable job opportunities for photographers across Africa. Background: The Startup, focusing entirely on Pan African visual content, takes its point of departure in the experiences gained from 8 years of working with a project supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark aiming to create an income-generating educational program for West-Africa’s largest school of photography. During this project, we introduced stock photography to the Malian market and focused on educating the students to enable them to compete in this market. 55 students, already working photographers that had an average income of 100 USD per month before enrolment, succeed in selling photos of a value of 500,000 € to leading companies and organisations worldwide. Customers include UN, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Ricoh, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and many more. SDGs: Quality education and decent work and economic growth, SDGs 4 and 8, are an integrated part of the Africa Reframed business model. When the United Nations In 2015 was launching the SDGs with Project Everyone, they did so with a campaign to share the global goals with 7 billion people in 7 days. This happened via global broadcasts, outdoor advertising campaigns, cinema ads, mobile partnerships and more. Because of the above, Images from our programme were among the officially chosen for the campaign and were singled out by the global campaign team as good education and economic growth in action. Misson: Most of the imagery we encounter from the African continent tends to either depict the beautiful scenery and wildlife or scenes of poverty, war, and desperation. While these indeed are bona fide aspects and challenges, Africa is also a continent characterized by immense growth, varied opportunities and not least, change. The mission of Africa Reframed is to capture and contribute to the spurring of this change by a visual reframing of the continent. A reframing that reflects African enterprise, innovation, and everyday life. Africa Reframed exists to create and promote this new imagery in the belief that by changing the visuals, we can help change the conversation. Thus an inherent part of Africa Reframed’s DNA, which is also mirrored in the name of the company, is to be a catalyst for the way the world looks at the African continent. The wish to illustrate the real Africa and thus to spur optimism and hope around its future makes the company strongly value-driven, and it is believed that such shared view will help bind contributors, clients, and other stakeholders close together. In February 2020 Africa Reframed received the investment from Innovation Fund Denmark.",København,"1,4,8,",,,,

Our mission is to help these children and their families to form a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. What we do is to digitalize clinical childhood obesity treatment. We provide a platform that connects clinics with their patients. Childhood obesity is a major global health issue leading to cognitive and psychosocial problems and several non-communicable diseases. “Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century” – Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, WHO. Successful childhood obesity treatment brings on a life-style change resulting in a sustainable weight after an initial relative weight loss. There are effective traditional methods but they require almost weekly meetings with the caregivers (USPSTF 2017), something that the families struggle to handle and the society cannot afford on any significant scale. We bring on a new treatment paradigm based on measurable outcome instead of process goals. This lowers the risk of giving incorrect advice and reduces the stress associated with treatment. Our program is enabled by data collected at home. The data is presented to the families in a way that promotes self-management of health, while it’s presented to the healthcare professionals in order for them to intervene in the pivotal moments for their patients’ success. More patients can thus be treated with a fraction of the resources per patient compared to traditional methods. Our clinical results are outstanding and have been verified in clinical trials. The clinics’ benefits The clinics get an overview of all their registered patients and their progress as well as access to built in tools for planning and managing their work. Evira makes it possible for the clinics to continually keep track of their patients and intervene in the pivotal moments for their success. The revolutionary aspect with the Evira treatment concept is that it is based on reliably measured outcome instead of self-reported behaviour. Evira is a tool to provide treatment but we are also integrating manuals and recommendations that makes it possible for any clinic to work in an effective manner. Evira makes it possible for clinics to provide effective treatment with a fraction of the resources per patient compared to current/traditional methods. The families’ awareness of their progress makes the process less stigmatized which makes the visits more focused. The reduced stigmatization and continuous contact also leads to fewer late cancellations and missed appointments – which are significant cost drivers for clinics today. The families’ benefits The families get an easy way of getting in touch with the clinic for assistance through the mobile application as well as access to scientifically validated educational material. The main benefit is that they will get high quality treatment with much less perceived effort and with less frequent visits compared to current methods with comparable clinical results.",Sweden,3,People,,,

2313,Simris,https://simrisalg.se/en/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/simris,"Simris is a multi-awarded pioneering agribusiness growing algae in Sweden. We save and protect endangered marine habitats, by producing unique ingredients from farmed microalgae instead of fish and other marine animals. Our goal is to be the beacon for positive change in business. We are based in Hammenhög, Österlen/greater Copenhagen, close to the sun and the sea. Simris is a pioneer in the development of microalgae as a novel crop and biotechnological production platform. We have developed an industrial process for growing microalgae to produce omega-3, as a vegan and superior alternative to fish oil and krill. We own the entire value chain from farm to bottle, i.e. from cultivation to finished product. We have recently started to develop further substances and ingredients from microalgae, to replace additional commodities from endangered marine species and ocean habitats at risk. Microalgae, or phytoplankton, are microscopically small aquatic plants. Just as land-based plants, microalgae grow by photosynthesis, where atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted to oxygen with the help of sunlight. Microalgae constitute the basis of the marine food chain, meaning that many nutrients that are crucial for human and animal health ultimately originate from microalgae. These substances eventually accumulate in higher marine organisms such as fish and seafood through the marine food chain. Many of these marine species are under the threat of extinction, due to overfishing and the destruction of marine habitats. Furthermore, marine commodities often contain high levels of mercury, PCB, PFAS and dioxins, due to toxic pollutants and plastics in the oceans. By sourcing marine commodities directly from microalgae instead of via fish or krill, we obtain better alternatives that are entirely plant-based and without the environmental toxins. In this way, the products are both safer for consumers, but also superior in terms of positive environmental impact. Cultivation of microalgae is a relatively novel technology at the intersection between biotechnology and precision aquaculture. The commercial potential is considered vast in a number of industries including food, pharma, skincare and advanced materials. However, commercial applications for modern microalgae technology are still limited, as most technology is yet at research stage or restricted to smaller development companies. Simris is one of the leading companies in the field and one of few companies globally that have succeeded to prove their technology at industrial scale and reached market phase for its products. Contrary to industry standard which uses yeast-like algae grown in closed tanks on sugar substrate, Simris uses photosynthetic algae for the production of omega-3. This process has positive climate effects through the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen. Also, Simris exclusively grows natural algae strains without genetic modifications that are common in conventional bioprocess engineering. Our first products are sold under the proprietary Simris® Algae Omega-3 consumer brand, targeted at the globally growing markets for wellness products and plant-based alternatives. Pending Novel Foods approval in the European Union, the products are currently launched on the US market, including trendsetting retailers such as Goop and Erewhon Market. We also have a distribution agreement in South Korea, and retail agreements with Sweden’s major department store Åhléns and largest pharmacy chain Apoteket. Simris was one of the first publicly listed vegan companies, and has been listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market in 2016.

There were also some the heavy weight solutions built upon the larger ERPs or CRMs. Molnix was born to fill this gap, spearheaded by the product Rapid Personnel Manager. It is a cloud-based HR app that is now in production in the humanitarian field – the Finnish Red Cross being our public reference customer.

With this app, our customers’ HR activities become considerably faster and more cost efficient. Especially in the field of disaster management, speed translates to higher impact (such as lives saved or aid delivered). Cost savings in turn stem from automation of many HR tasks such as alerting, reporting, data quality monitoring and use of public API:s. Cost savings are also a function of offloading work from the registry owner through enabling end users to perform many of the tasks themselves.

GlucoSet's sensors is unique because of it delivers high accuracy, rapid measurements and high sensitivity in the hypoglycemic range. GlucoSet is focused on developing products that fit into the existing workflow of nurses and physicians, maximizing the acceptance of new technology. The GlucoSet sensor is a biosensor with a hydrogel matrix incorporated with 3-phenylboronic acid. The gel contracts at rising glucose concentrations as a consequence of glucose-induced cross-binding of phenylboronic molecules. The hydrogel is fabricated at the tip of an optical fiber, and the whole sensor is covered with a semipermeable coating. The diameter of the gel is measured by an interferometric technique (illustration on the right).

2687,Brick Technology,http://www.brickapp.se,https://plusimpact.io/startups/brick-technology,"The Pitch We are bringing charging into the era of the sharing economy with an ecosystem of connected stations where users can rent power banks with cables, charge on the go, and then return at any chosen station. The What Consumption is increasingly unsustainable, and this is particularly true for consumer electronics. We all own dozens of chargers, for example, that we bought anytime our phones were running low on battery and we urgently needed them. Production today is focused on producing cheap electronics that we simply buy, use and discard. Today´s cities are built around the paradigm of mass consumption and the modern consumer owns a constantly increasing stockpile of discardable electronics. This has made plastics and electronics waste generation a growing concern all across the globe at the same time as the world´s resources are strained ever so intensely. It is therefore paramount that consumption patterns change towards sharing as opposed to owning, and towards upcycling as opposed to discarding. The How Our startup is tackling the issue of discardable electronics in the area where it arguably affects consumers daily life the most; phone charging. We bring charging into the era of the sharing economy by offering rented power banks with charging cables for all devices all around your city. With an easy scan of a QR code on the stations, users get a fully charged power bank that they can bring with them and keep for up to 5 days. When the user is ready, the rental can be ended by just inserting the power bank into any chosen station, that automatically locks the power bank and ends the rental in the users app. It is important for us to keep prices low enough to actually change charging behavior, and show the benefits of sharing over owning. By bringing charging into the era of the sharing economy we create a circular market for electronics, and maximize their utilization through sharing within the community. We see this as a modern solution to a modern problem. The Why We are inspired by creating solutions that not only make peoples´ lives easier, but also have a positive impact on the community. Our belief is that a true sustainability isn´t achieved by sacrificing consumers´ convenience, but on the contrary through innovative solutions that make smarter use of available resources. Through a global outlook one can identify these proven innovations and import them to new markets. When we first saw the popularity of sharable power banks in Asia, we knew this was a transformative idea that had to be brought to the rest of the world. Ever since then, we have worked relentlessly on developing our own take on the concept for the European market.",Sweden,"7,11,12,",,,,

Offset your individualized calculated carbon emissions by planting trees in the app. The What Based on our research, people would like to better understand their environmental impact. However, the current solutions are considered to be very time-consuming and tedious. Questions such as average meat consumption and kilometers traveled by car are difficult to estimate. But even if people manage to calculate their carbon footprint, we realized that they have trouble interpreting the result, as this is often an abstract number in kilograms of CO2. Hence, we identified an opportunity to help people understand their environmental impact visually, to encourage them to take action against climate change and deforestation. The How We believe our solution is a unique approach, as it is based on automation and convenience. In the first step, the user links the app to his bank account from our banking partners in the Nordics. In the app, you can see your own virtual forest. Whenever you spend money, the carbon footprint of this transaction is calculated instantly and results in trees being cut down. There are two ways to compensate for your impact: you can adapt your consumer behaviour to help the forest recover. Or you can plant new trees that not only appear in your virtual forest but are planted in the real world.. The Why We want to involve more people in the fight against the very serious problem of climate change. We aim that people make a difference by planting trees to compensate for their carbon footprint. The idea Breathe was born amongst three friends in the Interaction Design Programme at CIID in 2019. We contacted potential partners in the financial industry and received API access to our partner's databases to be able to calculate an individual's transactions into carbon kg. The next task will be to convert their emissions (kg) into the number of trees it takes to compensate the offset. The long term challenge will be to attract enough users to make the business viable.",,"12,13,",,,,

An eco-friendly high-tech product that fuses the state-of-the-art in electronics and amplification with ancestral craft techniques. The What The current production methods have entered into crisis, local industries, as well as the traditional handicrafts, have lost competitiveness to low-cost mass production abroad. Nowadays almost all production is outsourced to countries with lower working and environmental standards, leading at the same time towards economic, political, and social incisions. At the same time, there is a growing demand of the consumers for transparency, ethical production, and authentic origin of products. It is necessary to begin exploring different alternatives to compensate for this imbalance in which both local development and the environment are being deeply affected. The How At Mapu ApS we want to reconcile in a sustainable way two methods of production that since the industrial revolution have been moving apart - crafts and technology. We empower the crafts of Europe for the creation of sustainable wireless speakers with the highest acoustic standards by using a disruptive manufacturing methodology. We will fuse Portuguese natural materials with Danish acoustics expertise to bring together crafts and technology and competences from the North and South of Europe, combining past and present with a vision for the future. The Why We have a vision that goes far beyond making speakers. We dream of a Crafts Re-evolution to give back protagonism to traditional hand-crafts in our industrialized world.

2691,MakeImpact,http://www.makeimpact.io,https://plusimpact.io/startups/makeimpact-1,"The Pitch We help generate positive societal impact by changing people’s financial behavior. The What According to the UNCTAD (UN Conference on Trade and Development) World Investment Report from 2014, the total annual investments in SDG-relevant sectors in developing countries will need to be between $3.3 trillion and $4.5 trillion in order to meet the SDGs by 2030. Such estimates mean there is an annual financing gap of $2.5 trillion between current funding and what is required. The public sector is already doing a lot but to close this large gap, will require a major investment of resources from many actors, particularly from the private sector. The capital is already there. What’s needed is for that capital to find a home in well-designed, viable projects. In order to move this capital, the private sector will need to take financial action. People have the desire to take action but need help to do so. This is where MakeImpact will play an important role – helping people who want to make a difference through impact investing. The How We believe that there are 3 ways to help change people’s financial behavior in order to create a substantial positive societal impact Through Education: The more you know about making a positive impact, the better suited you are to actually do it. Through Investing: In order to help close the SDG financing gap with the use of private capital, investing your money in sustainable companies that work for a better future is the way forward. Through Tracking of Investments: Tracking your investments and becoming aware of which investments are sustainable or not will make you want to learn more about other companies that have a sustainable agenda and thereby re-educating yourself and potentially making more impact investments. In order to achieve the greatest behavioral change, these 3 will all need to be tied together – allowing people, in the best way possible, to change their financial behavior towards a better societal impact The Why We saw a need to help the non-investors getting started on their impact investing journey using the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework. The team currently consists of 17 passionate, innovative and purpose-driven people that help building a solution where the non-investor can use their money to make an impact in the world.",København,"4,8,17,",,,,

The What One third of all produced food is currently going to waste. It is a huge impact area which affects everyone on the planet. The problem is especially pronounced in the catering business when food is pre-prepared, for example when selling buffet, sushi or backed goods. Also supermarkets / grocery goods suffer from large quantities going to waste. The How RedMaden offers a solution for restaurants and stores to ""push"" their excess food and goods to consumers living nearby. Our platform optimizes the delivery of these offers and handles payment, so both seller and buyer is able to make the trade fast, easy and secure. This benefits both buyer (cheap food), seller (extra income) and of course the environment. The Why I got the idea for this project by looking at startups doing other things similar to this - although nobody seemed to be able to take advantage of the powers of our smartphones.

We focus on driving the digitization of the informal sector in emerging markets, making cities more financially sustainable and transparent. The What We help local and national governments to enhance Revenue Collection, SDG 17.1, and to migrate the informal sector to the formal, SDG 8.3. We address a huge problem that is waiting to be solved. The economic output of the informal sector can be as much as 50% of the GDP in many Sub-Saharan countries, but the tax contribution is only around 3%. This inhibits growth and makes governments dependant on foreign aid, although all necessary resources are available domestically. The informality of the informal sector excludes the people from social and financial services making them poorer and more vulnerable. The problem we are addressing is high up on the agenda of most governments as well as for development organizations. The How With our cloud-based platform SMARTR Tax, we digitize Revenue Collection, using state of the art web technologies in combination with mobile payments. The digitization of payments creates transparency and reduces the leakage of funds. When implementing SMARTR Tax we also digitize information about the informal sector, SDG 8.3, generating detailed data about a sector that has been invisible before. This data can be used for better planning and organization of the sector. For individuals, digitization means traceability of financial transactions, supporting the migration of people to the formal sector. We also enable access to social security services never received before. It all leads to financial inclusion. Digitization creates transparency which builds mutual trust amongst all parties. This all together leads to sustainable growth and the more financial autonomy of governments. The Why When talking with a mayor of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire we were made aware of the challenges of the informal sector and the problems with the financial exclusion of the sector. We are a team of tech entrepreneurs working with highly connected individuals from the African diaspora. We all see that by applying new technologies and know-how we can solve a pressing problem, generating a significant impact on the people in Sub Saharan Africa.",Sweden,"8,17,",,,,

The What More than 2 billion people lack access to clean water, according to UNICEF. Of these, nearly 160 million are forced to fetch dirty drinking water from open sources such as lakes, rivers and ponds. The causes of the water shortage are several, but climate change, drought, desertification, pollution and war are important explanations for the water shortage. In Sweden, too, we periodically begin to experience water shortages and we can probably expect that the water supply will change in the future. We use clean drinking water to flush the toilet, water the lawn and wash the car. The How On average, it takes several hundred liters to wash a car through a traditional car wash. Even worse for the environment is if you wash the car on the street, then the toxins run out into the storm water. Thanks to Woshapp, you can save the environment 200 to 500 liters of water compared to a regular car wash and the toxins are collected in a safe and environmentally friendly way. We loosen up the dirt remove it from the car with the help of microfiber cloths. Finally, the car is wiped off with a cloth so that it is completely clean. All the dirt is collected in the cloths, which is then handed to certified laundries to wash them with grease and oil separators to ensure that the product does not get into the drain. The Why Woshapp was founded in the summer of 2016 with the vision to revolutionize the car wash market by making it both simpler and more environmentally friendly for the customer. We have carried out over 10,000 environmentally friendly car washes and are now increasing our catchment area in Stockholm.

We make it easier to find the right trading partner who can treat the waste in a responsible way. We focus on circularity, CSR and use/end destination of the waste. Our goal is to provide a tool that can help in moving more waste from landfill into recycling. The EU is nowhere near its ambitious goals to improve recycling and reuse outputs to 65-70 percent by 2030 and to promote sustainable packaging to reduce landfill waste. One of the main reasons identified by European Commission mandated studies is that there is no singular, transparent platform to connect waste traders and track the waste streams. Industry professionals use static pricing, call lists, and old-fashioned sales and tender techniques to purchase and sell materials. The result is not only wasted administrative time and limited access to market traders, but the lack of a competitive marketplace for effective trade. Waste-outlet.com contributes to solving this problem - as well as the global problem of too much landfill waste, carbon outputs from primary source manufacturing, and litter pollution - by providing a transparent, low cost, open dynamic trading platform for European and global recycled waste material. Our mandate is that nothing is really waste - and by connecting buyers of waste materials to sellers of waste materials in a large network, we will lower the cost of recycling and reusing to support the circular economy. And contribute to a better future, converting waste material streams to help the environment and climate by reducing emissions (CO2) and reducing waste polluting land and sea. We are a team of waste industry specialists and digital innovators who have worked more than 2 decades within our areas.

The software is fed through sensors/microchips with data for energy production, load, the current pricing of electricity and storage data ensuring a tailored real-time optimization and prediction model for each connected system. This leads to better reliability, affordability and environmental friendliness of a customer’s microgrid. Besides the known problem that 36% of global final energy consumption and 42,5 % of globally CO2 Emissions is caused by electricity generation. We face additional issues such as the lack of electricity globally as well in Sweden, where urban areas outgrow capacities and new connections being refused to avoid blackouts. Most famously is the case of Pagen, which could not expand their factory in Malmö due to the concern of the city not being able to meet the additional energy demand. Furthermore, renewable energy is intermittent and difficult to control due to the nature of renewable energy sources such as sudden increase and decrease of energy production which affects the reliability and sustainability of the grid. In light of those issues that we face, we have created an AI with machine learning called the Hyve. The Hyve acts as the brain of a microgrid which is a system connected to for example renewable energy sources and energy storage in the form of a battery or for long term storage a hydrogen tank. The software is fed through sensors/microchips with data for energy production, load, the current pricing of electricity and wind data ensuring a tailored optimization and prediction model for each connected system. The Hyve automatically makes a decision when to buy/sell electricity, use electricity and store the energy to the storage. With our self-improving machine learning algorithm, the microgrid automatically becomes more efficient and effective over time, leading to cost savings for the customer by up to 30% compared to existing microgrid system with battery. Our software is a plug and play solution, ensuring that also single households with smaller microgrids are able to connect their systems easily to our solution. With The Hyve we aim to decrease the demand of energy from the grid, leading to a relief of the tense situation on the energy market, where we face a shortage of energy supply both locally and globally. Due to the fact that we use renewable energy, we will be able to reduce or completely eliminate the CO2 emissions caused by energy for buildings.

2704,UpFood,http://upfood.io,https://plusimpact.io/startups/upfood-1,"The Pitch UpFood is developing solar-hybrid dehydration systems to help farmers upcycle their harvested crops and reduce post-harvest food losses. The What The SDG 12.3 is to reduce food losses and waste by 50% by 2030. Today, around one third of all produced food is lost or wasted throughout the food supply chain. A large part of the losses happen at the post-harvest stage due to inability of farmers to immediately sell, properly process and safely store their produce. In developing countries, these challenges are direct cauces of poverty and hunger (SDG 1 and 2). By giving the farmers a solution to preserve their harvested crops, it gives them an opportunity to store the food much longer for their own consumption or to sell it in the market after the peek season when the prices go up. For the farmers and the families, this means better health and well-being (SDG 3), and economic growth (SDG 8). The How In UpFood we have invented a novel, patent-pending, off-grid, solar-hybrid dehydrating technology to reduce on-farm food loss in the post-harvest to storage stage of the food supply chain. The technology enables farmers to upcycle surplus harvest into new, value-added, dehydrated products. With this technology, farmers can increase the durability of their harvest, get access to entire new markets and reduce the enormous food loss in post-harvest significantly. The Why Seing the amount of perfectly edible food that is lost through out the whole food supply chain is heartbreaking, especially when you know that many people around the world are suffering from hunger and lack of food security. The existing methods to preserve food today are either primitive and inefficient or expensive and energy consuming. Therefore an affordable, energy-efficient, off-grid solution was needed.",,"1,2,12,",,,,

The What Forest inventories are expensive to process and inaccurate, causing 3 problems: 1) Utilisation of forest resources is inefficient and depresses margins. 2) Risks from climate change such as damage from storm, pests and fires are not well understood and therefore not managed. 3) Trees are the best method known to humanity to absorb CO2. However, there are no models today to calculate, verify and predict CO2 absorption. The How We have built a multi-layered GIS (geo-information system) with 100+ layers, integrating satellite data (optical, near-optical, soil, soil moisture, elevation and much more), LIDAR data from public sources and our customers, property boundaries etc. We use harvester data (the most accurate source of ""ground truth"") to calibrate the entire GIS system for prediction of wood species, volume, quality, boundaries for harvest planning and forest management. The calibration with harvester data is patent pending. This system is more accurate and cheaper than current practices! The core of our offering is the above prediction of forest inventory and derived parameters. We see very strong interest from the forestry industry globally for predictions of risks from storm, pests and fires. Also strong interest for modelling of CO2 absorption. Based on better forest inventories we can lead in all these markets and products. The Why We are 3 Co-Founders who have been for quite some time been interested in earth observation and the impact of climate change. Our initial idea was to predict air quality in cities (similar to weather services) but didn't find any interest to pay for such a services. As we started the firm our ambition was to bring deeper insights of the impact of climate on business processes. We have worked for some time on an energy solution, predicting energy from wind farms and have a customer for this solution in Fingrid, the Finnish grid operator. However, we focussed the firm onto forestry as there was such strong interest, particularly as climate change is having an every greater impact.",,"9,12,",,,,
2706,IMARIT,http://www.imarit.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/imarit,"The Pitch Imarit is a sustainable fashion brand that creates value for the fashion consumer who cares deeply about the environment and helps lift Alpaca weavers in the highlands of the Peruvian Andes out of poverty, particularly women, by providing decent work, driving business, and inclusive economic growth The What Our mission is to strengthen the potential of indigenous women to create sustainable social change in their communities through innovation, scalable transformation and the highest respect for their craft. Imarit weaves an unbreakable connection between artisanship and design to inspire women around the world to wear clothes produced at the heart of the Peruvian highlands. Imarit is a brand contributing to a number of priorities for Denmark's vision for the developing world, for example inclusive, sustainable growth, women empowerment, responsible consumption, and gender equality. The initiative falls clearly within SDG8 but contributes to several other SDGs notably SDG 1, SDG 12 and SDG 5. Our difference is our experience in social Dialogue with ethnic minorities to engage with the initiative of producing fashion that makes a difference in style, quality, and versatility; fashion that lasts. The How At Imarit we are dedicated to balancing what looks good with sensible and emphatical manufacturing, building on the extensive experience and understanding of what drives change in supply chains with artisans in Latin America, Imarit now seeks to scale and deepen its impact. Special consideration is given to every detail to create high quality, essential collections and lasting presence because of the classy style and the quality of the materials. With the connections between the two worlds, we have created a place where the old world of ancient traditions and communal living meets a new world of innovation and like-minded, free-spirited women, proving that it is possible to improve the working conditions of the alpaca weavers and boost their confidence in being part of sustainable handwoven garments of fashion The Why Imarit was born to create fashion that is both inspired and shaped consciously through the Danish design with the mission of empowering Andean craftsmanship Our name is a word from the Lenca language that means essence and origin and is inextricably linked with the creative power of nature and the feminine, in unity with Mother Earth. Imarit goes to the origin of one of the most sustainable fibers and by doing so the commitment is to create as much value addition to the ecosystem of the alpaca as possible. The experience and work close to artisans made us witnesses of how sustainable they can produce and live. The impact of a redefined design-production in their life and society has been the sparkle for the fashion initiative. It was important also to create a brand that would project back those simpler and ethical ways of living in a world where the advance of fast fashion has affected the general conditions and behaviors of our society.",København,"1,8,12,",,,,
2707,Solstroem,https://www.solstroem.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/solstroem,"The Pitch Solstroem is developing an end-to-end system for automatically generating, issuing, selling, and retiring traceable carbon offsets in real-time (no possibility of double spending), while also giving small-scale PV producers access to carbon markets. The What The Solstroem system makes carbon markets, and their subsidy effect, available to small and medium-sized decentralized solar installations in developing and emerging markets, primarily Sub-Saharan Africa. By having access to the global carbon market, these installations can sell their carbon mitigation and generate an additional revenue stream. This will allow for a faster deployment of solar installations, and a leapfrogging of centralized fossil fuel powered plants in these regions. The How Solstroem is an end-to-end Blockchain-based system for automatically generating and transacting fully-traceable and tamper-proof micro carbon offsets (MCOs). These MCOs can be voluntarily purchased by corporations and individuals wishing to offset their CO2 footprint. Solstroem aims at making carbon offsetting precise and verifiable, as well as easy and seamless for all involved parties. The Micro Carbon Offsets generated by the Solstroem system can be purchased on our platform in a few clicks, or can be fully integrated into existing IT systems. This will allow for real-time carbon offsetting through supply chain integrated plug-ins, for example automated CO2 offsetting of building emissions, product purchases or transportations habits. The Why Solstroem is a technology company based on three years of PhD research at the Department of Computer Science, at the University of Copenhagen. Our solution is backed by research funded by Copenhagen FinTech’s Innovation Network, and conducted by researchers from Copenhagen Business School and the Technical University of Denmark. Our team has substantial industry experience in projecting, and implementing large-scale solar projects, has managed projects in emerging economies, and has knowledge at PhD-level of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger technology applications in energy and climate markets. We are advised by high ranking environmental experts and public affairs officials.",,"7,9,13,",,,,
2708,Particle3D,https://particle3d.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/particle3d-1,"The Pitch We Print Bone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The What Today, patients who require bone replacement – due to either congenital bone defects or an accident or disease – can have a synthetic implant inserted (commonly formed from titanium or plastic) or a bone fragment harvested from their own body. In consequence, implants are either made of a material foreign to the body or are imprecise and imperfectly tailored to the patient's specific needs. Complication and re-surgery rates with current implants are high , all likely due to the poor fit and nondegradable, non-porous, non-vascularized nature of current bone implants. Titanium and plastic-based bone replacements often cause infection, bleeding and rejection, and can never become a natural part of the body. Harvested bone fragments may alternatively be used, but two operations are required, and this results in increased costs. Furthermore, bone replacements formed with harvested bone fragments often cause morbidity, necrosis and rejection . The How Particle3D is a new player in the bone implant market. The Company’s main purpose is to bring to market 3D printed patientfitted bone implants made of natural materials under the product name P3D Bone. The IP protected P3D Bone has multiple advantages over current implants, including: -3D printing enables the production of patientfitted implants for each patient, which therefore require only one operation and no manual adjustment in the operating room. -P3D Bone utilizes calcium phosphate, the major mineral of the intercellular composite of human bones, thereby reducing complications such as infections, bleeding and rejections. -P3D Bone is porous, resulting in a stronger ingrowth of bone and faster recovery. -P3D Bone degrades over time and is replaced by the patient’s own bone growth. -Surgeons can design the P3D Bone at the hospital or clinic to precisely match patient needs, which further reduces lead times. The Why Our motivation lies in the question: Why harvest bone when you can print it? There are more than 2 million bone grafts harvested form patients each year. Our technology allows us to make a patient fitted porous and degradable implant. Our mission is to provide 3D printed natural bone implants to reduce complications, improve functional & aesthetic outcomes and obtain faster recovery.",,"3,9,12,",,,,
2709,Fair Green,http://www.fair-green.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/fair-green-1,"The Pitch Fair-Green.com is a B2B e-commerce platform focusing on eco-friendly promotional products and giveaways to allow companies to make an environmentally conscious choice to advertise their brand. The What Fair Green is promoting RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION of promotional products by selecting items either made from recycled materials (recycle tires, pallets, plastic bottles, CD cases, etc.) or sustainably sourced plant fibers (jute, sugar cane, timber, bamboo, etc.). Thus, putting pressure on the production of these items for more environmentally sound solutions. Fair Green is also promoting RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION of promotional products by allowing companies to have an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional promotional products which are, traditionally, made on the other side of the planet from virgin plastic. The How Our solution is based on a SHORT SUPPLY CHAIN (all of suppliers are located in Europe); TRANSPARENCY (we showcase not only where the products are manufactured but also from what materials); and CONVENIENCE (traditionally to order promotional products you have to pick up the phone or ask for a quote, there is no way to order directly online, we want to change that outdated practice by allowing our customers to both order and customise their products online). The Why Fair Green stems from the will to challenge the current promotional product industry and offer to companies a way to advertise their brand in an environmentally conscious way. Ultimately, we want to challenge the status quo regarding promotional products and put environmental sustainability forward to make organisations greener.",,12,Prosperity,,,
2710,NetRepair,http://netrepair.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/netrepair,"The Pitch NetRepair is a platform with the objective of effectively connect people who want to repair and/or extend the life of a product with an appropriate repairer with the consequence of reduction of waste and incentivize jobs. With aim to create social, environmental and economic impact. The What The social problem to attack is the lack of exposure of people with skills and tools that can be economically active to the society, once this impact is positive the reparability of the products, by extending the life cycle of those product reducing the amount of landfill and incineration of waste, where SDG #12 is directly involved. Another important point is the data analysis and traceability of repairs to analyze the needs of the market and incentivize some kind of jobs, and track the equivalent amount of CO2 emissions saved by repair. The How Creating a platform where the repairers can sign, they can be localized by the end-user and filtered by kind of product, brand, distance rating, delivery service among others, to optimize the service and localize the best person for the user. At the same time, the platform has to quantify the repair and get some statistics about the repair market. The Why There was a connection of various factors: One was the interest in recycling and visits on waste landfills some years ago made me think about how to reduce that amount of waste generated even before arrives at that site. Another factor is the unemployed people with different skills, including close friends, makes me think how to gather these people to make people feel useful, including the use of tools by optimizing that use on a concept of share economy.",,"11,12,",,,,
2711,Aarhus Soundsystem,http://aarhussoundsystem.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/aarhus-soundsystem-1,"The Pitch We want to change the way speakers are produced. At Aarhus Soundsystem we strive to develop the most sustainable speakers in the world - without compromising on sound quality. The What Almost 9 out of 10 Danes regard global climate change as a serious one problem, and the proportion who are concerned that climate change will exist injury to themselves during their lifetime has increased from 30 percent in 2015 to 41 percent this year. (Concito Climate Barometer 2018) Our interest in speakers has given us an insight into the speaker industry, this is why we know that, very polluting production methods and materials are still in use. The How That is why we are a company that considers sustainability, recycling and climate friendly production into every aspect of our business. Our circulation principle ensures minimal pollution throughout the product life cycle. So far we have succeeded in replacing traditional wood with bamboo. We are working also keen on developing and finding sustainable materials and production methods for the remaining parts. We expect in the long term to be 100% CO2 neutral Among other things, by planting of Bamboo fields in developing countries. The Why The idea for sustainable speakers came up after the Co-founders Lasse and Troels saw a TED-talk where Bamboo was used as a sustainable building material in Bali. We could combine this back then with our knowledge back from having built speakers for festivals. Over the time, the idea was matured through various conversations with engineers, entrepreneurs and business people.",,12,Prosperity,,,
2712,Kanpla,https://www.kanpla.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/kanpla-1,"The Pitch Kanpla is developing a digital platform to help canteens reduce food waste by taking orders. The What Food waste is an enormous sustainability issue. Denmark alone wastes 700,000 tons of food each year. At Kanpla, we care about food waste in school canteens. Without knowing how many people will eat a given meal, canteens have to prepare more food than necessary. Canteens are wasting dozens of kilograms of food every day, and studies show that there is a potential for improvement. Pursuing the goal of Responsible Consumption and Production (UN Goals), we want to reduce food waste in canteens as much as possible. The How Kanpla is a digital platform for ordering canteen food. Through our web application, parents can create a meal plan for their kids in advance. No need to give children money for lunch, the food is already paid for online. Canteens know exactly how many orders there are, so they know exactly how much to cook. They can afford to offer a wide variety of dishes while reducing leftovers, and thus food waste. The Why As students, we had the problem of food waste in canteens right in front of our eyes. Realizing how big the problem actually is, we discovered an enormous business opportunity. The market consists of outdated solutions if any, and it's here for us to disrupt it. We want to provide an excellent product that makes reducing food waste effortless.",,12,Prosperity,,,
2713,Hopspots,https://www.hopspots.dk/en,https://plusimpact.io/startups/hopspots,"The Pitch Hopspots aims to create more fun, healthy and active school days, by combining learning with movement. The What It makes perfect sense to make active learning a part of teaching on schools, unfortunately it is difficult for teachers to succeed with it in practice. They lack time and hands to do it with thus the desire to create active learning is a cause of frustration and challenge. Research also shows that pupils learn better and more when they move. That is because movement increases the blood flow to the brain, which increases focus and working memory. But, making sure that the pupils get to move in their everyday school life and teaching can be difficult and time consuming in practice. The How This is why we created Hopspot, an interactive learning tool that is designed to actively engage children in their learning by combining it with play and movement. Hopspots consists of 12 wireless spots that are connected to an app for iPad and a speaker uniter, and in that way combines technology with the physical space and focuses on children’s interaction. Our product trains body and memory whilst playing and learning. Thus, it can be used at all ages. For instance, Hopspots can help 3-year-old children recognize animal sounds, 7-year-old children with learning the alphabet, 10-year-old children with multiplication and division, 15-year-old children with collaboration and discussion, and help elderly citizens with having fun while preventing dementia and other age-related illnesses. The Why Aviaja came up with the idea for Hopspots 10 years ago when she needed a topic for her master’s project at Aarhus School of Architecture. She was passioned in finding a way to combine technology and physical space with focus on children and their interaction. For several years no one worked on Hopspots. But with the arrival of the new school reform in 2014 new opportunities for development arose and Aviaja chose to make Hopspots a reality. Movement was now a requirement in teaching which perfectly matched Hopspots’ philosophy, namely movement, learning and play all in one. New technologies, such as the iPad, made it easier to bring the idea to life and the market had matured and was now ready for the product.",Aarhus,"3,4,",,,,
2714,Air0,https://air0.fi/about-us/#our-story,https://plusimpact.io/startups/air0,"The Pitch Air0 has developed a care-free total solution for clean indoor air - Clean Air as a Service. It's a fully programmable & automated clean air system scaling up to any needs. CAaaS model includes indoor air quality monitoring, high-end air purifiers, central management via cloud and expert analysis. The What We can survive 30 days without food - for developed countries, one can always choose not to eat rotten food. We can survive 3 days without water - for us, bottled water is available option for places, where the tap water is not clean. But we can only survive 3 minutes without air. We are forced to breathe the air, no matter how polluted it is. According to WHO, each year millions of people die as a result of being exposed to bad air quality. The ultra fine particles generated by traffic and burning, are so small, they can penetrate to our blood stream via our lungs. Air pollution will then affect to our health causing lung cancer and other lung diseases, heart attacks and stroke, as well as other, less severe health issues, such as headache, nausea, fatigue and flu. For our market, there are two big issues causing polluted indoor air; very polluted outdoor air, which leaks indoors effectively (e.g. in China) and sick building syndrome (e.g. in Finland). The How The core of our solution is the unique and patented smAIRt® technology. It combines the best of the traditional air purification technologies, mechanical and electrical filtration, to achieve maximal amounts of clean air. For air purification, it is the most important factor. Since perfecting the purification technology and creating two beautiful stand-alone products out of it, we have also taken a step further, to provide our customers the best possible service, in a simple and easy way from set-up to usage. We call it Clean Air as a Service. CAaaS was launched in 2019, and it is a fully scalable, full-service concept for delivering clean air. Our CAaaS model is an IoT solution, enabling real-time follow up for air quality in all the different rooms and properties at a glance. Air purification is fully automated, fully programmable and centrally managed for all the rooms. Expert reports and analysis are available, maintenance and support is included in the service fee. The Why The idea for Air0 came from one of our co-founders, Mr. Rajala. He has decades of experience with aerosol physics and fine-particles, and just before Air0, he was involved in the indoor air industry in the Asian market. While spending time there, it became obvious that there was a serious air quality problem and people were desperately searching for a solution. They needed air purifier that was capable of producing large amounts of pure air, while being silent, energy efficient and requiring little maintenance. They needed a new innovation for the air purification. And that was the challenge Mr. Rajala was ready to face. From day 0, Air0 has been eyeing to China market and today we already have a distributor in China. Other team members have various reasons that drive them every day; passion for hi-tech and cleantech development, some have personal background with indoor air quality issues and others are just keen to provide cleaner air for people.",,3,People,,,
2715,Decideret Cider,https://www.decideretcider.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/decideret-cider,"The Pitch We want to make the best wild cider in the world on 100 % Danish apples and prove that cider can be every bit as quenchy and informal as beer, as complex as wine, as sour as lambic, and as fruitful as freshly squeezed juice. The What Every year, in the private gardens of Denmark, 5 million kilos of apples fall from trees and are abandoned. On the island of Fyn (Funen, eng) there is a long-standing tradition of handing in surplus fruit to the cidery in Ørbæk where apple donors sign a paper stating that no pesticides have been used. This is ecology and old school reduction of food waste without a label. This year we have filled some of our fermentation tanks with juice from these crispy garden apples of Fyn. We also use selected varieties from Lilleø for our small-batch cuvées. At Decideret Cider we do cider workshops and DIY-courses as well with the sustainable initiative GroSelv and Meyers Madhus – because real cider is in fact something everyone in possession of good apples can make. We are also one of the initiators and organizers behind Rigtig Cider - Copenhagen Cider Festival. The How In Denmark we are blessed with apples that balances a tart acidity with a fruitful apple sweetness. Our cider culture is on the other hand depleted. Our food culture has been elevated with the new nordic kitchen - now it is time to take a look at what we drink. We crush and press apples, ferment juice into cider, and bottle it by hand in small and big bottles - cider can be kept well in both a wine cellar and in a breast pocket. Some ciders are to be drunk young and fresh with a full throttle apple flavour. Other ciders gain flavour when aged in oak. For all our ciders we can say that they are wild fermented and they are made solely from Danish apples with a focus on craftsmanship, curiosity and reducing food waste. In Copenhagen we distribute all our ciders ourselves on an electric cargo bike with a trailer. The Why It all started in the late summer of 2015 in Nørrebroparken in Copenhagen. We were five old friends wondering why we in Denmark don’t have a culture for drinking good cider. France, England and Spain all have their own proud traditions and vinification techniques. In august that year we borrowed a press and went straight at it. We gathered apples from the gardens and parks of Copenhagen and ended up with a small production; we filled some 100 bottles in a garage next to Utterslev Mose in the northwestern part of Copenhagen. The following year we moved “the production” into a container under Bispeengbuen in Nørrebro/Frederiksberg where we made some highly explosive cider. Next stop was Grønttorvet (the old vegetable market of Copenhagen) where we produced around 3000 L of highly drinkable cider. We delivered the cider on our bikes to bars, special kiosks and restaurants around Copenhagen and when the summer of 2018 ended - we had been on sale for 5 months - we were sold out.",,12,Prosperity,,,
2716,SON OF A TAILOR,https://www.sonofatailor.com/aboutus,https://plusimpact.io/startups/son-of-a-tailor-1,"The Pitch The future of clothing will be formed by challenging convention, and embracing innovation. We celebrate the principles of a truly custom made piece of clothing, and embrace technology that allows us to make it available to everyone, everywhere. The What The throwaway culture is an unfortunate part of fashion. If you’ve only paid $8 for a T-Shirt, what’s stopping you from buying another one once the first loses its shape after a few wears? Seven wears. That’s the average life span of a high street garment before it is discarded. It seems that, somewhere along the line, we stopped caring about the things we buy. Let’s just say we’re partisan here. We make T-Shirts in a radically different way. But this is a problem. It’s a problem that lies with both consumers and manufacturers, and it leads to an enormous amount of waste for the environment, and a careless attitude to products and people. The How Sustainability is at the core of what we do. By having no inventories and very low returns of goods sold we obtain a CO2 footprint half of other fashion commerce retailers. Plus, by having full control over our supply chain, we can make sure our seamstresses and pattern-makers are working under better circumstances. Each year, more than 2 billion T-Shirts are sold, making it one of the best-selling clothing categories in the world. At the same time, we believe it is one of the most neglected. We decided the T-Shirt was the most impactful place to start making fashion better – for the consumer, for the environment, and for the people involved in the production. Every T-Shirt we produce is accompanied by a hangtag. It is signed by the seamstress who custom-fitted the garment, and it’s addressed to the person receiving it. The hangtag is a small gesture, which at the same time embodies the essence of Son of a Tailor. It serves as a reminder that the T-Shirt is made to order and sewn specifically for that person’s unique measurements, and that a real person constructed it. The Why We partner with carefully selected production facilities in the EU who are as passionate about making fashion better. They challenge us, and we challenge them, which is an important dynamic because it’s the only way we can make better products and a better industry. The result is garments that are timeless and built to last for years. We hope and think that’s where fashion is headed – to a place where we focus less on buying more, and more on owning fewer quality garments that we wear for years. Garments that are more sustainable, of higher quality, and constructed with longevity as its main purpose. That’s the staple of Son of a Tailor. And we’re fiercely passionate about becoming your staple, too.",,"8,13,",,,,

Let us help you find out and get data on this, whereby you can reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries and create a healthier workplace. The What The root cause of repetitive strain injuries (or musculoskeletal disorders - MSD) is exposure to MSD risk factors. When you are exposed to MSD risk factors, your begin to fatigue. When fatigue outruns your body’s recovery system, you develop a musculoskeletal imbalance. Over time, as fatigue continues to outrun recovery and the musculoskeletal imbalance persists, a musculoskeletal disorder develops. 80 million people in the EU suffer from MSD, leading to 12 sick days in average, and costing societies €320 billion. We will solve this problem one step at a time. First step is MSD in the elbow - aka tennis elbow. The How MLI® Elbow is a revolutionary solution give concrete numbers on muscle strains and variations in the workﬂow for companies allowing you to reduce the risk of MSD and create healthier workplaces. It also helps the user to be aware of the muscle strain level and to change behaviour to reduce the risk of MSD. The Why The PRECURE story begins in 2012. Søren is a physiotherapist. He had a patient - Marie - who kept coming back. Month after month. Nothing seemed to help. Listening to his patient’s problems, Søren conceives the idea of the world’s first digital therapist. In 2016 and based on his idea, he gathered a team of experts within electro engineering, data science, automation and robotics, and created the very first version of MLI® Elbow.

They were looking for ways to improve their handling of goods during transport, and asked Jesper to develop a concept that would make it possible to increase the capacity of their trucks. With his background in design and manufacturing, Jesper built the first SpaceInvader prototype. The How SpaceInvader creates value in your warehousing, assembly, transportation and distribution thanks to a pallet rack enabling double stacking all the way through your supply chain. SpaceInvader makes it possible to stack higher, so you can load and store more goods using less space, thereby achieving a greater fill. Optimising the packing of trucks will lead to fewer of them on the road and a direct reduction in emissions. That is good for the environment and makes the transportation industry more sustainable. The Why SpaceInvader's mission is to streamline transport and storage down to every single pallet, thereby creating a more sustainable transportation industry for the benefit of customers, businesses, the environment, and society as a whole. Our vision is to introduce a new standard for the stacking of pallets, that will change road transport the same way the shipping container changed the shipping industry.",,"9,12,13,",,,,

It is a smart electric, foldable, cool and very affordable bike The What Producing cars is a high-energy industrial process that uses lots of resources. On average, the production of a car alone accounts for 42 g of CO2 emissions per km driven. But actually driving your car is what really bumps up greenhouse gas emissions, of course. Considering the average road use of European car drivers, different fuel types and average occupation, and adding emissions from production, driving a car emits about 271 g CO2 per passenger-km. But what if you wanted to reduce your emissions to an absolute minimum? That's where we come in! The How By making eBikes cool, sexy, practical and affordable, we wish to take bicycling global as the preferred mode of transportation for more people in urban areas. In the summer of 2016 we launched the original MATE on Indiegogo and successfully crowdfunded USD 6,8 millions. In July 2018, we launched our second crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to fund the new MATE X. This campaign has raised more than USD 17 millions, making it the most successful European crowdfunding campaign in history.

The What ISH Spirits is a Danish brand on a mission to make it easy for mindful drinkers to lower their alcohol intake – without compromise. Today ISH produces a range of alcohol-free spirits, with a wide pipeline of new innovative products in the making. Current flavors include award-winning GinISH and RumISH which mirror the flavors of typical gin and rum, simply without the alcohol. Made from extracted natural botanicals ISH is a natural product, without any sugar. The How Our alcohol-free spirits are made from natural ingredients such as juniper berries, vanilla, and nutmeg – the same ingredients you’ll find in a typical gin or rum. We’ve carefully extracted the aromas from these natural botanicals and spices and, with proprietary recipes, combined the ingredients to obtain the familiar flavors you recognize, as an alcohol-free alternative to classic spirits. The Why With a constantly growing awareness on health and longevity, the rise of the alcohol-free trend is emerging and growing rapidly. This segment is not necessarily about not drinking alcohol, it’s simply being aware and conscious about what you drink and on which occasions. We call this group “Mindful Drinkers” and we cater to the demand for NoLo cocktails – concoctions with no- or low alcohol. This allows everyone to go out, have a good time, be social and get proper drink experiences that are not evolving around alcohol, but rather the inclusive feeling of sharing a drinking together.",,"3,12,",,,,
2729,MicroWISE,http://www.microwise.eu,https://plusimpact.io/startups/microwise-1,"The Pitch Microwise has develope a test kit for automatic detection of live organisms in ballast water, Ballastwise, which will help the shipping industry staying compliant with the new IMO ballat water regulations. The What Shipping has been identified as a major pathway for introducing invasive species to new environments. The effects of the introduction of new species have in many areas of the world been devastating. In order to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another the Ballast Water Management Convention has been adopted by the The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the US Coast Guard. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to clean their ballast water to a certain standard. A number of approved ballast water management systems are available on the market, however, there are no approved systems for which can automatically test water quality according to the IMO and USCG ballast water standards. The How BallastWISE represents a new method for quantifying microbial life in relation to existing instruments used for testing ballast water. Manual microscopy using motility and fluorescence is still the benchmark against which automated systems are tested, and in many ways, BallastWISE is an automation of that procedure using software, cameras and optical assemblies. Currently, the only excepted compliance test must be performed in the laboratory and is often based on manual microscopy, which is time consuming and expensive. It is our ambition to make BallastWISE the first portable test kit which will go a long way towards a true compliance test in the field. The Why We heard about the Ballast water convention back in 2013, before it was adopted by the IMO. At that time the market for Ballast Water Management Systems (BWMS) was developing, but there was very little interest in test-systems for ballast water quality. However, we were sure that test tools eventually would be needed. We had worked with image analysis based tools and camera-technology for analysis of micro-organisms for many years, and had software tools that we found suitable for automatic testing of live organisms in water samples. We applied for funding from several Danish funds, who supported the development of Ballastwise, which was much more challenging than we initially thought it would be. The Ballastwise system is now fully functional, and is being tested by several external laboratories.",,14,Planet,,,
2730,Refarmed,http://refarmed.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/refarmed-1,"The Pitch Refarmed has developed a low-impact and customer-integrated vertical farming concept for local supply that utilizes circular economy. We bypass the conventional food supply chain and transform waste and risk in distribution into fresh story food with a green footprint. The What In Refarmed we want to disrupt the conventional food supply system, and create a win-win situation for farmer, climate and consumer. Therefor we have developed a customer-integrated vertical farming solution that produces leafy greens on the premises of our B2B customers. That way we: a. reduce the negative climate impact from transportation, cold storing and packaging as well as food waste in every link of the supply chain. b. save the farmer the 25-30% of his revenue that usually goes to distribution. c. can give our customers and the end consumer the freshest and most nutritious story food on the market, since the quality of the crops are no longer compromised on the journey from farm to fork. This we believe to be the future of farming. The How Through a cloud based operating model we can efficiently operate multiple vertical farms and match the exact local demand. This demand driven business model reduces the risk in farming and investing, since we have no overproduction, guaranteed revenues and no price fluctuations. Automation and digitalization minimizes the most expensive labour and gives us vital data to optimize our business on. By applying innovative green technologies we can furthermore exploit residual resources from buildings with high emissions of CO2, heat, water or bio waste while creating several economic and environmental benefits. So, through a demand driven business model that bypasses the conventional supply chain and by applying circular economy we reduce the climate impact of our herbs, lettuces, and microgreens. The Why We were motivated to create a smarter business model for the production of leafy greens by the poor quality of the crops in the shops. We found many talented farmers in Denmark with wonderful products. But we also saw how the quality of these products were compromised through distribution, and how farm economy were being pressurized by supply driven production vulnerable to price fluctuations and loss in production. So we thought that it had to possible to take vast amounts of money that is put into distribution and instead use to create value for Customers, farms and climate.",,"11,12,",,,,
2731,Digital AML,https://www.digitalaml.com/om-os,https://plusimpact.io/startups/digital-aml,"The Pitch Digital AML ApS is a Danish RegTech company that provides a compliance solution to Danish companies. The primary target group is the app. 12.500 non-financial entities subject to the Money Laundering legislation. Major segments are law firms, external bookkeepers, auditors and real estate agents. The What In recent years, stories of companies that have violated the Money Laundering Act have made headlines in the media. Certain cases have even caused political action at ministerial level with the participation of virtually all political parties in the Parliament. The headlines range from Syrian warriors who take out SMS loans shortly before departure and to exchange offices that receive proceeds primarily from drug crime and finally the country's largest banks or their affiliates. Whereas the focus has been on the banks and their shortfalls in complying frequently overlooked is the 12.500 non-financial entities who also must be compliant. These are extremely important in the financial ecosystem as no chain is stronger than the weakest link. Data from the Danish Business Authority annual report shows a general lack of compliance. Of 125 visited companies 60 have been referred for police investigation due to severe lack of compliance. The How Digital AML ApS is a Danish RegTech company that provides a compliance solution to Danish companies, We offer a SaaS solution to the market that enables companies to comply with money laundering laws, including the 5th Money Laundering Directive and the new Money Laundering Act, includes risk analysis, credentials and verification, KYC, PEP, sanctions lists, continuous monitoring, etc. The solution to a large extent pulls existing data from public and private databases thus offering a vast time saving versus manual routines.

2732,Fruit-up,https://fruitupdk.wordpress.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/fruit-up-1,"The Pitch Upcycling agricultural waste in Africa: The cashew apple The What Did you know that on top of each cashew kernel there is an apple that weighs 5-10 times more than the kernel? Africa accounts for 40 % of the world's production of raw cashew nuts - which leaves the continent with 10 million tons of cashew apples each year. Cashew apples are currently considered as waste and are left on the fields to rot. The cashew is popularly known as the ‘poor man’s crop and ‘rich man’s food’. In almost all of Africa, cashew farming is done on small-scale family-owned farms in small rural villages, and many farmers can hardly make a living from the crop. The How We're turning this current waste stream into valuable food ingredients. E.g. the cashew apple has a high content of pectin: a gelling ingredient widely used in a variety of food products. Currently, we're doing some tests in collaboration with Teknologisk Institut extracting pectin from dried cashew apples. We're also looking at an application for the juice, making a concentrate that can be used in e.g. icecreams or as a healthy drink. The cashew apple contains 5 times more vitamin C than an orange and is rich in antioxidants and polyphenols. The Why We want to give the farmers an additional revenue stream just by utilizing a resource that is already there. By creating this value stream we are directly impacting their livelihoods and the communities they live in. We believe that the cashew apple has many valuable properties and we will explore these to find the perfect application of it.",,"1,8,12,",,,,
2733,Rel8,http://rel8.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/rel8,"The Pitch Rel8 aims to revolutionize traceability for mass produced plastic products The What Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects, problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Effects on humans include disruption of various hormonal mechanisms. The How rel8 develops zero-impact traceability technology for plastics production. We focus on manipulation of surface textures in the molding step, thereby avoiding unnecessary process steps and materials. How? — Marking during molding cycle — Microstructured markings — No ink, label or pigments — No machinery or equipment — Scans with Vision and smartphone — Only method to work on black plastic The Why In 2005, Guggi Kofod )CEO) led a research group into new nano-composite materials for applications as ""artificial muscles"". We investigated electrical, mechanical and dielectric properties of novel composite materials incorporating nano-meter-sized fillers, as well as many applications of these devices.

2734,2p1,https://tvapunktett.se,https://plusimpact.io/startups/2p1,"The Pitch We accelerate the shift to a more sustainable whole through circular economy. The What Sustainable habitats make heavy demands, for example, on planning, construction and management of both new and pre-existing settlement. Quality, knowledge and competence in the construction industry have a very important part to play in this connection. Housing and commercial premises account for roughly 30% of Sweden’s end use of energy and for about 7% of its total emissions of greenhouse gases. Electricity accounts for nearly half the sector’s energy use, followed by district heating (30%) and biofuels (10%) The How We are in the business of Enlightenment. 2p1 sells light as a continuous deployment service (LaaS). The customer pays to access the right light in the right place in exchange for an annual fee/sqm. All our products can therefore be individually adjusted and updated over time, and manufactured on recycled hardware without harm to the environment.

2735,WAIR,https://www.sustainablewair.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/wair,"The Pitch Giving Textile Waste a Second Chance: Upcycled Footwear From Textile Waste The What Every day tonnes of textiles are being discarded where less than 1% of these are recirculated back into the fashion system. We want to create upcycled footwear made of discarded textiles in order to fight this global textile waste problem while also minimising the use of new resources. Circularity is at the heart of everything we do at Wair. Not just in terms of upcycling textile waste, but throughout the whole lifecycle of our shoes. Every design decision is therefore made with the aim to create a shoe that can be recirculated at the end of it’s lifespan. From using the already existing textile waste to carefully selecting suppliers that use non-toxic and less resource intensive materials. Every part of the shoe (from the soles to the laces) is chosen to create a shoe with as low an environmental impact as possible. The How Wair is a Copenhagen-based startup, aiming to give textile waste a second chance by transforming it into upcycled shoes. We don’t see used textiles as waste, but as a valuable material, that we can use to make awesome and sustainable footwear. We want to contribute to a more circular fashion industry. In order to do this, we also want to empower people with the opportunities that the practise of upcycling represents. Through our upcycling workshops, we are building awareness and giving people the opportunity to be a part of the solution by designing and/or making their own shoes. The Why We are Lili and Amrei - two sustainability nerds that are currently working towards making Wair a reality. The idea was a result of Lili's masters thesis about fashion upcycling, where she became aware of the insane amounts of textile waste going to landfill/being incinerated at the moment and seeing it with her own eyes. Upcycling represents a challenge in terms of manufacturing due to it being an unstandardized material. However, we believe that there is a big potential in upcycling textile waste, one that has not yet been fully explored by other companies. If we are successful in building a scalable upcycling business, the properties of uniqueness and low material cost have the ability to revolutionize the fashion industry.",København,"12,13,",,,,
2736,Second Sun,http://www.secondsun.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/second-sun-1,"The Pitch Second Sun is providing sun reflectors to sports stadiums to improve natural grass growth in a more sustainable and cost-efficient way. The What The traditional solutions for promoting grass growth in stadium pitches are based on lighting systems on wheels that through high-voltage powered artificial lighting are able to promote photosynthesis and thereby reinforce grass growth. Most of these are based on light-weight metal rigs on wheels with lighting armatures of 1000W on average and capable of emitting homogenous light in the spectrum between 400 and 700 nanometres. The energy needed and consumed by stadium owners globally for maintaining a high and professional quality of their grass pitches are enormous and has seen a significant increase in the last decade. It is estimated that in the EU alone, more than 4.000 stadiums exploit up to 40 TWH/year, with the largest stadiums consuming 10.000 MWh/year2. 40 TWH/year is the equivalent of the total power consumption of New Zealand per year, which makes sports stadiums one of the large categories of power consumers in the EU and responsible for 11.5M tons of CO2 emissions/year. The How The Second Sun solution is the first of its kind and it constitutes a completely new approach and design in the field of solutions that provides lighting for supporting grass growth in stadium pitches, as it is based on using reflectors installed directly into the roof of the stadium to utilize the rays of the sun instead of electrically powered lighting for cost-effective and environmentally sustainable grass growth support. The Why A lot of people have a natural interest in sports and especially in sports that are being played on a natural grass pitch but not a lot of people know the crazy amount of energy that is being used to keep the grass pitches inside sports stadiums nice and green all year round. When we realized the significance of the challenge and the huge impact we could have on the environment and on an industry as existing as sports, we sat out to solve this challenge using our entrepreneurial spirit and engineering mindset.",,"7,9,11,",,,,
2737,Seasony,https://www.seasony.dk/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/seasony-1,"The Pitch Seasony wants to revolutionize agriculture and bring sustainable food production closer to the consumer. The What Seasony is solving a bunch of the problems caused by modern agriculture, with its vertical farming technology. Farming uses 70% of our freshwater supply and every year the excessive use of pesticides and fertilizer is closing more and more water wells and is harming our surface-water. The increasing number of people on this planet requires a more efficient agricultural system which not only produces more food but with less waste. The How With indoor, vertical farming we can control everything about the growing of produce. Instead of changing the plants to accomodate future needs, we change the environment by bringing it indoors. We can construct a clean environment where we need 0 pesticides, use 95% less water and use around 60% less fertilizer. We recirculate everything and can produce just the right amount, all year round. The Why In 2050, we will be 11 bn people on this planet and with not enough land to supply us. Current agricultural processes are not going to be able to support us all and let us have a planet with thriving biological life. We think our technology can help make our food production system better, and with our automation solutions we can make it good business too.",,"2,11,12,",,,,

We want to introduce you to an experience that combines quality, sustainability, health, and a deliciously unique taste to make you feel good! The Why NUMBA was founded by Kareem Ahmed who was born and raised in Sudan and has lived in Denmark since 2004. During his childhood, Kareem was introduced to a wealth of foods known for their immense health benefits. He realised that these ingredients were nowhere to be found in the local food and beverages in Denmark. This, and the fact that Kareem wanted to create something that connected African and Scandinavian culture, inspired him to establish NUMBA and to put baobab, moringa and hibiscus at its heart. Kareem has always been passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship and has a great desire to continue to develop NUMBA’s portfolio in the coming years. THE NAME NUMBA IS A CONTRACTION OF: NUBIA and SIMBA - a fitting name for something as colourful as Nubian culture and as full of life and strength as a lion king.

Browse items for inspiration, upload your own, and match with others whose items you like. The What There are 2 main issues we're tackling: 1) The “Coincidence of Wants”: Wikipedia describes it as an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants. A bartering economy is founded on such parties exchanging goods, sometimes services, without any monetary medium. 2) The rise of conscious shopping: We're witnessing an increasing number of conscious shoppers and swappers meeting offline in every corner of the world, but no Internet stage where they can express themselves. As a green and responsible people living in one of the world's greenest countries, we didn't find an online place to meet other like-minded people, chat, share experiences, find cool things, and express ourselves. The How Fineswap is an app that allows users to connect with each other and swap goods without the need for monetary exchange. The platform employs machine learning and gamification techniques to connect users with matching interests to each other, thus solving the “Coincidence of Wants” problem. To cater for the needs of a growing number of conscious shoppers all around the world, we have plans to further employ gamification in Fineswap by launching virtual swapping rooms.

The Why As the dominant species, humans still have a lot of work ahead of them to turn the world into a better place. This starts with the simplest of things (respecting each other) and continues with tougher actions (living sustainably). Fineswap is our contribution towards making the world a better place. We rely on a modern technology to gamify bartering and make swapping fun, social and effective. Bartering has been around for thousands of years and it has proven to be extremely successful in times of need and among both poor and highly educated societies, and the timing is just right! Our dream is that people from all around the world use the platform to make social encounters with each other, enjoy and reuse their stuff and thus allowing others to enjoy them too.",,"11,12,",,,,
2741,DropBucket,https://dropbucket.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/dropbucket-1,"The Pitch DropBucket is a simple and sustainable waste bin made out of recycled cardboard. The What The world’s growing population presents a challenge for the environment as more people will have to share the planet’s limited resources. Waste policy and planning can be an instrument to prevent valuable resources from ending up in landfills and incineration plants. It also provides a common approach for disposal and waste sorting for citizens and businesses, which increases resource recovery. The How The DropBucket waste bin is based on a simple, folded cardboard structure. It easily transforms into a pyramid-shaped container that fits into its surroundings. An automatic bottom allows for large numbers of bins to be put up within a short period of time. The DropBucket is made of robust corrugated cardboard, consisting of recycled material so once it is no longer needed, it can be disposed of easily along with the rubbish. A water-resistant coating ensures that the cardboard does not get soggy, and the pyramid-shaped construction allows for a low centre of gravity, which strengthens the stability The Why We are a team of environmentally conscious engineers and designers. DropBucket enabled us to create a positive impact in our community, and earned us a bunch of cool awards: Red Dot Design Award: Best of the Best (2015) Frederiksbergs Iværksætterpris (2015) Årets Studenter Startup på DTU (2015) Talent 100 - Berlinske Business (2015) Årets Iværksætter på Færøerne (2015) Ivækstprisen: Årets Kvindelige Iværksættere (2014) Scanstar pris: Bedste emballage i Skandinavien (2014) Innovationsprisen: Flot 2. plads til innovationsprisen (2013) Venture Cup: Booster Pack vindere (2013)",,"11,12,",,,,

2743,Healper,http://www.healper.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/healper-2,"The Pitch Healper is an online booking platform that matches people with mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety and addiction with the right psychologist that fits their needs. The What In Denmark, mental disorders account for 25% of the disease burden and cost society 55 billion DKK annually with more than 2,000 people receiving therapy from a psychologist every day. Further, too many individuals do not receive timely help as they cannot cope with the draining 5-hour process it takes to find and book a psychologist. At the same time, U.S. experience shows that only 20-40% of people find a psychologist they trust and have ´chemistry´ with. This is tragic, as just one bad experience can cause a client to completely drop out of or postpone his/her therapy. The ineffective booking process and the risk of a poor patient-therapist match mean that many people continue to struggle with mental illness who could otherwise be treated. This has major consequences for individuals whose mental illness markedly impairs their quality of life, but also largely affect their family and friends. Furthermore, this is a major problem for society. The How The cornerstone of Healper is an optimal match between each client and psychologist combined with a personal tailormade user journey. The most important factor in the match is optimizing the likelihood of a strong therapeutic alliance between the psychologist and the client. The best condition for this therapeutic alliance appears when the psychologist reminds the client of someone, he/she naturally trusts. Therefore, we determine matches based on the psychologist’s experience, geography, style, and demography. We have set up an operational analysis algorithm with variable constraints that mathematically assess the matching parameters and can choose which psychologists best match each client. In the U.S., we have found that these parameters can improve the match rate by approximately 350%. Healper’s team has extensive experience in advanced mathematical models and AI, and are using a culturally adapted version of the U.S. algorithm. The Why Three years ago, when one of the founders was studying in the United States, he developed with two friends a diary app that uses artiﬁcial intelligence to improve the mental health of psychologists’ clients. He, however, he realized that the psychology market was not ready for the technology and found there were lower hanging fruits with greater value in facilitating the relationship between psychologists and clients, so he began to research the market and build the team.",,3,People,,,

We have refined the design and technology to perfection and made sure all our products are made of recycled material and are fully recyclable. The What It all began in 2015 with a small 3D printer and a vision of a holistic circular process, from design to end consumer and recycling. Two years later in close collaboration with leading 3D-printing manufacturers and governmental research facility RISE we were able to make the first large scale prototypes. After countless hours of designing, printing and testing, our first product was born - the REFORM lounge chair. The How Our products are made out of 100% recycled material making it possible for us to stay true to our goal to contribute to a sustainable future. We firmly believe that linear supply chain, material waste, transportation and long lead times must end. All our products are designed and manufactured with a sustainable circularity in mind. We believe this is the future of furniture design and manufacturing. As technology develops, more materials and possibilities will be available to us, making it possible for us to push the limits even further. We believe the time to reshape the future is now. The Why SCULPTUR is driven by the vision of utilizing new additive manufacturing processes and business models. Together with the fast-moving 3D-printing industry we aim to make it possible to produce our products as close to the customer as possible. As our network of printers with large object capacity grows, we can produce globally, just sending the file to the printer, making both production and transport as clean as possible. To encourage recycling our customers receives a refund when returning a SCULPTUR product to an authorized recycling facility.",,"9,12,",,,,
2745,Rebox AB,http://www.rebox.nu,https://plusimpact.io/startups/rebox-ab,"The Pitch Rebox: a startup applying circular economy to moving boxes The What Our current economy is linear and based on a take-make-dispose approach that has proven itself to be highly unsustainable. We want to bring circularity into one important aspect of human life: moving in and out. Moving requires many boxes that will be only used once although their lifetime is much greater than that. Rebox has created a logistics system that allows for each box to be used to its fullest capacity, safely. The How The company's idea is to reuse moving boxes through three channels. The first is home by picking up moving boxes from customers' home, the second by collecting used boxes from stores, and the third is to wholesale boxes to moving companies as many of them, especially the smaller ones, cannot afford to stock moving boxes. Delivery and future pick-up of the boxes are both included in the price. For every ten boxes that are collected, Rebox commits to plant one tree via the ""Vi forest"". Reactions from customers are very positive, they do not have to handle the boxes themselves. So far, 40,000 moving boxes have been saved. The Why Fredrik got the idea for the company in connection with his job at the time in shipping and container freight, and his and a friend's move. He did not want to throw away his moving boxes, so his friend came and picked them up for himself. According to Fredrik, shipping and Rebox's idea is really the same business model, so in 2014 he started testing the idea as a hobby, and then started the company in 2015.",,12,Prosperity,,,
2746,Virescent Education,http://www.virescent.org,https://plusimpact.io/startups/virescent-education,"The Pitch Virescent Education is developing a board game to help schools and businesses engage with the UN Global Goals, sustainable habits, and 'factfullness'. The What There is a lack of understanding about the world around us and the mission of the UN Global Goals. I noticed this problem in 2016 when I was the only teacher in the whole district that was aware these goals existed. Now there is a chain reaction of both businesses and schools wanting to implement the goals. Our mission with the board game is to engage with both the business and education communities to increase awareness, educate, and inspire players to want to learn more about their world and take action towards the Global Goals. The How We want to gamify the concept of achieving all 17 Global Goals by the year 2030. To do this, we have created a collaborative board game where players learn and discuss good lifestyle choices and trivia that allows them to share their prior knowledge and experience to choose the right answer. With the right amount of knowledge and good lifestyle choices, the goals can be achieved in the game (and in real life!). Players also take ownership of the experience because the order in which the goal is achieved are dependent on what the players think, making every game-play a unique and impactful experience. The Why I am a teacher that noticed that integrating the UN Global Goals in the classroom was difficult and discouraging when you are the only teacher trying, I also see businesses trying to change their value plans to be more sustainable but have trouble selling the idea to their employees or leaders. I am approaching this problem at an angle in which anyone who plays can feel inspired and have a better understanding, and therefore, feel more comfortable integrating these concepts into the classroom or business they run.",,"4,13,",,,,
2747,Just Plants!,http://justplants.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/just-plants-1,"The Pitch Just Plants is moving the planet to a greener future via plantbased deliciousness. We do this by developing fresh convenience meals to be offered in supermarkets. Our first couple of meals are already displayed on our website (justplants.dk) and more products will be developed in the coming months. The What Climate action: The production of animal products require significantly more land than plantbased products, and they are thus a major souce of deforestation. In the process they also emit more greenhouse (e.g methane from cattle farming). A shift towards more plantbased meals can therefore help slow down the emission of greenhouse gasses. Life Below Water: The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 33% of the world's fish stocks are subject to overfishing. A shift towards more plantsbased meals will help reduce this figure. Life on Land: It takes approximately 7 kg of grains to produce 1 kg of beef, and it takes 4 kg of grains to produce 1 kg of pork. These are examples of the land use that is required to produce animal products. A shift towards more plantbased meals will therefore enable reforestation and potentially increase biodiversity. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet The How Our meals guarantee harmony at the dinner table. It can be difficult as a parent to always find the time and energy to cook nutritious meals that the everyone in the family can enjoy. Often, the limited time available will result in a quick (and perhaps not so healthy) solution that satisfy cravings, but provides neither nutrition nor a good conscience. With our meals we are sneaking in the vegetables in a way that everyone can enjoy, regardless of age and preferences when it comes to taste. This is the trick to create harmony and a good conscience at the same time. The fact that the meals also helps the environment is an added bonus. This ""trick"" is not yet seen on the Danish food scene. The Why Concerns about environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, species extinction and the lives of animals. All three founders of Just Plants have adopted a fully plantbased lifestyle years ago and have only grown more passionate about the cause in the years since. Indeed, the founders became friends through their shared concern for these topics. Founding the company together was thus a meaningful way to take the passion to the next level.",,"13,14,15,",,,,
2748,The Poli,https://www.the-poli.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/the-poli,"The Pitch Making the world more sustainable through greatly designed bags and accessories by setting a higher standard, not only to every detail in our production but to the industry as a whole. The What Traversing from East to West and experiencing industrial pollution to mass consumption, we came to an idea to reduce the environmental footprint. This through careful selection of products for the global market, starting with the bag industry. We often overlook how a product is manufactured and what kind of materials are used in our day-to-day consumption. However, our choice of purchase has huge impacts both on the environment and human health. Since the consequences of this careless consumption are more evident now than ever, it is time to scrutinize our behavior and take our responsibility towards the people and the planet. The How Because of our strong environmental focus, it’s natural to choose the absolute best environmentally friendly materials that exist on earth. Therefore, The Poli is offering bags, made of the most sustainable natural fiber jute and ecological cow leathers. High environmental standards not only depends on the materials used, it also calls for the importance of several production aspects. We want to go further than the sustainable resource use by combining a regenerative design concept together with ethical business and leadership from our manufacturing to business offer. The Why As The Poli is here to lead the way and be an example to the rest of the world our journey will never end. We will always strive to do things better by keep thinking outside the box. Our ‘zero waste policy’ is implemented in the production plan through converting wastage of materials into usable resources. Through our continuous production improvements efforts we also strive to reduce waste as well as resources such as water and energy consumption in the production process. We also hope to be able to use recycled water and renewable sources for energy in our future production plan, in order to reduce environmental impacts further.",,12,Prosperity,,,

The What Only in Denmark and only in households, 4.500 tons of aquafaba are generated every year, which is translated into 45 tons of wasted plant-based protein. We want to reduce liquid food waste and find a use for these resources that are being discarded. (SDG 12) Furthermore, dairy cheese production has an enormous environmental impact. Cheeseityourself sustainable alternative with plant-based ingredients whose production generates remarkably lower GHG emissions. (SDG 13) There are already commercialized plant-based alternatives to dairy cheese. However, they generally have a low nutritional value and only provide consumers with fat, water and less than 1g of protein. In addition, their flavor is unpleasant. Shifting diets toward plant-based food does not mean compromising neither on nutrition nor on taste and we want to enable consumers to enjoy their culinary experiences as well as to follow healthy dietary habits. (SDG 3) The How We provide businesses and individual consumers with a tool to revaluate their own food waste. We want them to play a leading role and engage them in this mission. Our solution is easy to implement and delivers nutritional value as well as delicious taste. Our customers just have to mix their liquid food waste with our ingredient mix, heat the mixture for ca. 5 minutes in a pot and cool it down for a couple of hours. After that, their own plant-based cheese will be ready to eat! They can personalize their own recipes by customizing our base ingredient mix with their favorite herbs and spices. The Why Sustainability is in everyone's mouth nowadays and more and more people are becoming aware of how important it is to change habits, reduce food waste and consuming less animal food. However, although people might become aware of the problem, they might not know what they can do to solve it. Instead of developing just a new product, we developed a tool that helps everyone to be part of the change. Furthermore, plant-based diets don't need to be boring or tasteless and with Cheeseityourself we wanted to give people the freedom to design their own recipes and adapt them to their taste!",,"2,12,13,",,,,
2750,Sharefox,https://sharefox.no/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/sharefox,"The Pitch Sharefox is the rental system of the future, circular by nature. The What One of the key elements in the transition from ""use and discard"" to circular economy is to rent rather than sell products to customers. Sharefox is a platform provided by Tooler AS that was established in 2016 to participate in, and influence, the future utilization of resources. Circular economy - which aims to keep resources in the economy for as long as possible - is central to our value business model. The How Renting a product must be as easy and convenient as shopping for a similar product in an online store via tablet or mobile phone. This is why we developed an easy online booking system, accessible from both mobile, tablet and PC. By digitizing rental processes, we remove weight of administrative costs, and can be more present for customers. Distribution of the rented product is flexible and reliable thanks our varied delivery options and tracking system. The Why Our ambition is to establish a platform for rental and circular services that is so complete and user-friendly that it will be the preferred tool for rental or circular services regardless of industry. It should also lower the costs of those already operating services and lower the threshold for those who want to start new services",,"11,12,",,,,

The How We encourage companies to travel less and work in virtual reality instead. In the period of 3,5 years, we have talked with more than 500 business entities and figured out their needs in terms of meeting spaces. Consequently, we have developed 8 different environments in Virtual Reality allowing them to do collaborative work in VR.

The What The film industry has not championed the SDGs nor social impact properly while thousands of films fall by the wayside and don’t reach a viewership as they should. We are trying to solve both of these problems by creating a series of film festivals partnered together with the UN SDG community to champion narratives, build mini summits that welcome experts and filmmakers to push and educate audiences into becoming active participants with us in these battles for climate change, and to end poverty and fight for gender equality, etc. The How We provide a global series of showcasing events where films tackling SDGs are championed and experts are gathered to discuss how media and film can be used for more than awareness, viewers can be rallied to do more than be a passive audience. By creating SDG platform initiatives we are committed to making social impact and SDGs our mandate, and we make donating a majority of project procurement proceeds to causes within the SDGs.

The What According to the WHO, 2.2 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water. This leads to sickness and 485,000 diarrhoeal deaths each year. Geographic and economic inequalities persist and people living in low-income settlements usually have less access to clean water. Some boil to clean contaminated water, but this has a negative effect on the environment leading to significant CO2 emissions and deforestation. The How SolarSack has developed a household water treatment solution only using sunlight to purify water. The SolarSack cleans 4 liters of water within 4 hours and can be refilled 500 times providing a total of 2000 liters of safe water. SolarSack’s purification technique is based on the 25 year old solar water disinfection technology, which has been endorsed by the WHO as a safe way to purify drinking water. It works by harnessing UVA and UVB rays as well as heat from the sun. These three processes combined kill more than 99,99 % of the dangerous pathogens in water. The Why Many good purification methods exist, but they are all prohibitive expensive for end-users, who are often among the poorest people on the planet. SolarSack's low price point makes it available for the people who have less than $2 a day. The SolarSack improves the health of the users by reducing water-borne related diseases and saves 2 trees and more than 500 kg of CO2 emissions when substituting the use of wood fuel for boiling and cleaning water.

The platform supports woman in building a strong network they can draw upon to advance their career. Our goal is gender equality in leadership roles and management boards – to the benefit of the individual, corporations and society at large. The What SDG 5: gender equality Despite the fact that it’s recognised more women in top management has a positive impact on the bottom line, gender equality in Danish leadership roles and management boards leaves a lot to be desired. With 27% of woman in leadership positions Denmark is the lowest ranking of the Nordic countries and even below the OECD average of 31%.1 When it comes to corporate and board management numbers are even lower. In 2018 the proportion of women in top management was 13% and board management 17% , and the trend is decreasing. For instance only one of the C25 listed companies has a female CEO. One challenge is that candidates to fill top leadership positions are recruited via network and since these are male ‘heavy’ it creates a vicious circle that takes effort to interrupt.1 Goodtalks address the network issue that prevent women from landing top management positions by offering a platform where woman can build strong alliances and get support to grow their career. The How Goodtalks offer professional women a digital platform that allows them to build and strengthen their network across roles, functions and businesses. It works as an exchange of experiences and knowledge, which given the digital format removes barriers by making help, sparring and sharing easily available. In addition the setup encourages honest exchange of both good and challenging experiences, which serve to fuel our members with needed competencies and courage to advance their career. Further members are regularly offered the opportunity to meet in person at live events where they network and listen to two inspiring speakers (e.g. CEO’s and politicians) who share the unglossy version of their career stories. The Why Spending many years in Corporate World, Pernille who established Goodtalks, would at times find herself in organisations that had a deep negative impact on her mood and wellbeing. So much so that she would bring the tension home and take it out on her family. Searching for an explanation (and solution) a pattern emerged. Business where she had struggled to thrive all had a lack of female competencies in leadership roles and management boards in common. An imbalance that affected the entire organisation. A deep desire to facilitate balanced organisation via gender equality and change this dynamic took root. Pernille identified community as a key leaver to achieve this. An environment where women can meet up online and offline to share experiences and support each others growth. She also recognised that in order for the sharing to be relatable and have a transformational impact it had to be honest and ‘unglossy’. Soon after Goodtalks was launched.",,5,People,,,

The What More than 65000 bikes have been reported as stolen in entire Sweden every year since 2014 and these numbers are increasing every year. Swedish bike riders are looking for a solution that may secure their valuable asset as well as provide flexibility to share their asset with family friends. In 2018, Sweden was introduced to micro mobility, initial purpose of micro mobility is to offer first/last mile transport, many companies started scooter business in Stockholm. More than five companies are operating and many more to come. These big companies are only focusing in the centre of Stockholm. Currently if anyone wants to start scooter service in their local community or local region, it is NOT viable, it costs a lot to build platform for securing and renting assets. Scooter companies have created a headache for city planners all over the world, it is very hard to control the parking and speeds of these scooters. In helsinki, 33% more emergency cases were reported due to scooters. The How Three big society issues and one simple solution - Frekis Frekis is building platform where consumer can order IoT smart lock with GPRS positioning and with anti theft alarm. It is a subscription based service. Users can create geofencing for their assets and share with family and friends by adding their identities in asset. Private persons can never rent their assets. If they want to rent , they need to upgrade account to business. As a business owner, I can order ""Track, lock and geofencing "" subscription for my assets, once assets are added , these will be available for consumers to rent by scanning QR code and once the ride is over, consumer can close the session by parking asset in right parking spot. Real estates/co-working spaces may offer scooter/bike rental service as subscription/on-demand to their tenants. Geofencing offers three valuable things - Speed control of assets based on time and location - parking zones The Why Some of my colleagues had incident last year, Thiers bikes were stolen in the streets of Stockholm, we were looking into solution, where assets can be secured as well as shared among us at workplace. Idea was to have one bike at work instead of 10. At the same time, we wanted to have scooters instead of bikes. Many people are crashing their private as well as rental scooters and getting injured and in worst case dead :( due to high speed. so we came up with following mission. Frekis mission is to increase reuse of resources by simplifying micro mobility and reduce need of ownerships.

The What Electrical devices are the second biggest electricity consumer in offices and businesses after heating, accountable for about 15% of an entire business's energy consumption. A large part of the consumption of such devices is just standby consumption and devices that are not in use (5-15% of a device's consumption). Our research also has shown that people care less about their energy consumption in offices in comparison to at home (41% vs respectively 12% of respondents) and that more than half of the people never or rarely shut off power strips when leaving the office or home. Investing in an energy efficiency tool or solution often requires renovation, difficult installation and involves high costs making it not suitable for many businesses, in particular, smaller businesses. The How Riot Innovations is offering eese, the easiest, cheapest and most efficient way of reducing the electricity consumption of electrical devices by automatically cutting standby power and rewarding sustainable behavior of employees. It offers all the features necessary to maximize the efficiency of electrical devices, including real-time monitoring, remote control of all connected devices, the automatic shut-off of standby consumption, individual settings, timer settings, tips for more efficiency and a reward-based encouragement for employees to reduce consumption.

2760,Norsepower,https://www.norsepower.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/norsepower,"The Pitch Our mission is to reduce the environmental impact of shipping by providing efficient, easy to use and reliable auxiliary wind propulsion for ships. The What Norsepower was founded in late 2012 with a mission to reduce the environmental impact of shipping by providing efficient, easy to use, and reliable auxiliary wind propulsion for ships – through its Rotor Sail Solution technology. The Rotor Sail technology is based on the magnus effect. When wind meets the spinning Rotor Sail, the air flow accelerates on one side of the Rotor Sail and decelerates on the opposite side of the Rotor Sail. The How The thrust induced by the Magnus effect can be utilized in ship propulsion by placing a cylinder on the open deck of the vessel and by rotating it around its vertical axis. A variable electric drive system, which is powered by the ship's low voltage network, is used for rotation of the Rotor Sail. The Norsepower Rotor Sail Solution is around ten times more efficient than a conventional sail, because more lift is produced with a much smaller sail area. Due to its simplicity, it requires no reefing or crew attention when in operation. The Why Our vision is to maintain the market leader position in a growing market for auxiliary wind propulsion systems for large ships. Our entire team is strongly motivated by our mission to reduce the environmental impact of shipping with our Rotor Sails. Since its establishment, Norsepower has raised more than USD15m to facilitate development, piloting, and commercialisation of the Norsepower Rotor Sail Solution.",,"7,9,14,",,,,

With all the cases of and the significant increase in bankruptcies, bad payers, fraud and all of the money laundering scandals, it has become a real problem not knowing whether or not to trust one another when doing business, especially for startups. All rating agencies are focus on enterprise solutions and the big-money, but the one has the most to potentially lose is Startups. They lack the financial capacity to withstand losses from a costumer going bankrupt and them taking a loss. Thats why we offer our services at a significant discount for all startups. Good Creditinformation should be for everybody.

2763,Nordic Snails,https://www.nordicsnails.com/inenglish.html,https://plusimpact.io/startups/nordic-snails,"The Pitch Help us put a new sustainable protein source on the food map: Snails! For centuries, snails have been a delicacy in Europe - now it must enter your and my everyday kitchen. The What Because snails are produced more sustainably than for example beef and are both protein rich and low in fat. Meat production has 10 times less impact on CO2 than red meat. In 2016 we started developing a prototype of a farm concept and in 2017 we had our first stock. The snails we cultivate is called “Voldsnegl” in Danish and is considered the ""little brother"" to the french Bourgogne snail, more commonly known in Denmark as “Vinbjerg snegl”. The Voldsnegl is smaller, has more tender meat and is suitable for a Danish farm production as it can reach an adult size in just half a year. The How We produce and process meat from snails and produce snail caviar. We want to create greater availability in the market for free-range edible snail meat which is very tasty, protein-rich and low-fat. Production of free-range snails is new in Denmark. Several countries in Europe are producing edible snails, including Great Britain, Ireland, Holland, Belgium and Austria, so why not also in Denmark? We want to develop and test new delicacy snails products. The plan is to disseminate the knowledge of Danish free-range snails by making them available in the supermarkets and explore new products and recipes that you can try in your kitchen at home. In this we want to engage professional chefs to develop new food products for your supermarket. The Why We all have to make a difference to help reducing CO2. Alternative protein sources to red meat is one way. Our vision - We want people to have the opportunity to taste this new and more delicate version of snails which hasn’t really been available on the Scandinavien market until now. - We want to contribute to a wider range of alternative sources of protein, where the food is also healthy, climate-friendly and has a nutritional composition of protein, fat and nutrients. - We strive for a high animal welfare and want to optimize production without compromising on this. We are working to be registered as an organic producer. - We want to supply top quality food products and not compromise on quality, neither regarding snail meat nor our ""snail caviar"", which is a very small niche product we, as the only ones in Scandinavia, make of snail eggs.",,"2,3,15,",,,,
2764,Resen Waves,http://www.resenwaves.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/resen-waves,"The Pitch Powers autonomous instruments in the sea and provides real-time data connectivity The What Until now instruments and machinery in the sea have been powered by batteries, PV or diesel generators, which require regular ship operations to replace batteries or maintain diesel generators, which is costly and not always possible due to bad weather. This means that the power usage have had to be limited. Economizing power is normally done by cutting back on data transmission, which limits the applications of the instruments. All these draw backs are effectively solved by installing a Resen Waves Power Buoy in the sea, where the power and data connectivity is required, as a plug-and-play solution. The How Resen Waves is the first company in the World to provide continuous power and real-time data connectivity to autonomous instruments and machinery in the sea, as a plug and play solution. The Resen Waves Power Buoy powers a battery pack on the seabed through the mooring line. The battery pack can then feed power to various instruments and machinery on the seabed. The buoy can log data from connected instruments. These instruments are connected through a fibre optic connection and is available on the smartphone. It provides direct access to machinery and instruments, no matter where the instruments are placed in the seas. This data will be transmitted from the buoy to shore per satellite, 3G or 4G connection. The Why Resen Waves was founded in 2010 with the purpose of developing a cost-effective wave power buoy technology that could be commercial, starting in small scale, whilst having the potential of being increased to larger industrial-scale units in the future. Just as the wind turbines started in small scale and grew in incremental steps to large scale turbines, so will wave energy machines.",,"7,14,",,,,

Narrowing the scope down and looking solely at teachers, Sub Saharan Africa needs 19,7 million NEW teachers by 2030, nearly twice as much as exists today. Teacher that are able to teach form the foundations for the continents transformation. it is time to shift the paradigm from providing courses and training based on perceived needs to building education offering on top of what professionals ALREADY can do. Adopting and developing scalable approaches to skills recognition brings cost-efficiency, speed and relevance to the African skills development arena. The main challenges of education are related to access, relevance and quality. Out of the three, competent teacher affect relevance and quality, that is why focusing on them is crucial.

The What Quite often, traditional rescue ladders mounted on piers, bridges and quays are hard to spot as they do not distinguish themselves from the dark surfaces in the harbour. Especially at night, they are difficult to see. Despite frequent maintenance, traditional ladders manufactured in steel are subject to accelerated corrosion. Data collected in Denmark document that 25% of drowning accidents occur in harbours. The need to improve safety is increasing as more industrial harbours are urbanised. The How LifeLadder addresses two problems: Visibility and maintenance. LifeLadder® is made of maintenance-free, reinforced synthetic modules in a bright, yellow color that ensures visibility during the daytime. Solar-powered LED lights provide visibility at night, easy recognition of the access to rescue and thereby a clear direction to safety. The Why Traditional safety ladders of galvanized steel have not changed for decades. The material is not visible, and it is corrosive.

The What Pain management and prevention should be centred around a multidimensional approach - focusing on physical activity and exercise but also on building understanding of pain and the confidence in one's ability to deal with pain. Frustratingly, MSK pain is a global epidemic, and a lot of the current treatment is part of the problem, not the solution: 1. Still, too many health practitioners promote passive treatment approaches and passive coping strategies. 2. For most, the active approach that best treats pain requires active habits to be formed, which includes both belief and behaviour change. Sadly, no one offers this high-quality care in a way that supports habit change. At Reach, we build up people’s ability and confidence to self-manage, so they do not become dependent on health professionals. In everything we do, we strive to make recovery and prevention more reassuring, accessible and motivating. The How Currently patients complete a 8 minute online assessment and receive a personalised video exercise program, we then motivate and evolve their program to recovery. During your time with Reach, we’ll work with you to develop the confidence you need to stay active at your own pace, in a way that suits your lifestyle. We’ll also support you with ongoing educational material to make sure you fully understand what’s going on ‘under the bonnet’ of your pain. You’ll get access to new educational material at checkpoints throughout your road to recovery so that you can make informed choices about how best to deal with your symptoms and keep progressing. The Why This is where it all started, and what drives everyone at Reach, everyday. - We really believe in all the benefits of being active - social, stress relief, increased energy, better health and more. - And we admire all those trying their hardest to make themselves and their lives better - and I genuinely believe most people are trying their hardest in life (shout out to Brene Brown’s book on Shame and her ted talks for this learning). - There are loads of great tools and people helping you to be active and stay active, but when things go wrong and you’re held back by pain and injury, the available choices are all so frustratingly inconvenient, slow and boring. - SO, we are ‘empowering people when their active best is under threat’. And we hope that by helping people become stronger and move forward, we can help make their lives that much better, in-turn increasing their capacity to make the lives of those around them better, and bit by bit we’ll make the world that bit better.",København,3,People,,,

Even with electrification of cars, transport accounts for a large part of global CO2 emissions, expected to increase due to more cars and further urbanisation. Congestion, noise, space requirements and resource depletion are other drawbacks of car usage, while public transport is less attractive due to lack of freedom and various real and imagined risks (virus, crime, etc). Cycling is healthy and eco-friendly, but unfortunately too few people use cycling as personal transport due to its unpracticality in bad weather and during winter. Podbike AS has developed a four-wheeled e-bike with full weather protection to replace cars on short daily commuting. Our goal is to make cycling attractive for all and for all seasons. We do this by combining the comfort and safety of a car with the benefits and healthy lifestyle of cycling. We provide a year-round mobility solution, a new category of vehicle in between bicycles and cars, that is safe, fun and sustainable. PODBIKE is an electric-assisted four-wheeled, all-weather bike (e-bike). With a maximum assisted speed of 25km/h, anyone can use a Podbike without the need of a license or training. Compared with cars, PODBIKE is an extremely energy efficient personal transport with low environmental impact, easy to park and provides exercise while cycling. PODBIKE is not wider than a bike trailer and can be used everywhere bikes are allowed, avoiding congestion. The vehicle has no bike chains and gears, reducing maintenance to a minimum. PODBIKE is disruptive since it mates creature comfort of a car with social and health benefits of bikes and turn it into a cool, fun and comfortable product attractive for the mass market. The market to be addressed is mainly urban areas where Podbike will be an environmentally friendly and comfortable alternative to passenger cars and bikes/e-bikes on daily commuting to work/ school. PODBIKE is designed to meet the high demands of today’s consumers on design, comfort, functionality and safety. With electric assist, you travel at 25 km/h and using your own pedal power you will go faster and get additional exercise. In our workshop, we focus on sustainable and ethical production with a minimal carbon footprint. We use recyclable materials for the vehicle body and frame. In the future, the Podbike® will park itself, charge battery when needed and come to you when you ask for it. The Why Our motivation (and concern) is the ongoing and escalating climate change primarily caused by excessive human consumption of fossil fuels. The innovation builds on many years of R&D and user experience of e-bikes and current velomobiles. Founder, Per Hassel Sørensen, is an engineer with long experience as a product developer from various industries. His interest into mechanics and electronics, bikes, cars, computers and all kind of technology has also been a driver for the development of Podbike. His Master thesis in 2014 (when studying part time for MSc Sustainable Energy Technology) was about how to re-define velomobiles.

2771,Cleaner Future,http://www.cleanerfuture.fi/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/cleaner-future,"The Pitch We combine energy efficiency, uninterrupted power and solar power generation The What The intelligent Dynamic Power System uses solar panels with diesel or gas generators to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels and to provide clients with comfort and the reliability of the power supply. The heart of our solution is the Dynamic Power System. It balances unsymmetrical loads, filters harmonic currents, compensates reactive power, and supplies high current peaks on demand. This greatly improves the generator efficiency by reducing the losses and preventing overheating. Our solution replaces diesel with solar energy and gives you savings every day. The How The Dynamic Power System provides excellent reliability, balancing unsymmetrical loads, filters harmonic currents, compensates reactive power, and supplies high current peaks on demand. The energy surplus can be stored in the batteries or sold to the power utility. In case of power failure in the grid, the Dynamic Power System immediately isolates our client’s system from the grid and continues an uninterrupted power supply to our client. The change of power supply from the grid to the energy storage is undetectable to the client and they continue enjoying uninterrupted power. When the generators are used as a back-up, the Dynamic Power System supplies power from solar panels and/or from the energy storage during the downtime of the generators. The Why Our business and motivation is based on our willingness to offer solutions combining three areas of sustainability; ecological, economical and technical. We realise that practically the only way to make ecologically sustainable solutions widely popular is to make them economically viable for our clients.

Vegetabilisk garvning använder inte krom som är skadligt för natur och cancerframkallande för människor. The How De globala problemen är specifikt hänsynslös hantering av existerande resurser (hudarna) där mycket kastas och majoriteten av resten bearbetas med krom som är mycket skadligt för naturen, de som arbetar med det samt de som kommer i kontakt med den färdiga slutprodukten och naturen (igen) när den kastas och kromet oxiderar och blir cancerframkallande. Dessa löser Satellitskinn genom: Att ta tillvara på existerande resurser och minska avfallet Att låta skinnen garvas inom EU för att minska transportsträckorna Att garva skinnen kromfritt med vegetabiliska garvämnen som nedbrytbara Att utveckla en ny vegetabilisk garvningsprocess för vildsvin som inte finns sedan innan. Att öka exponeringen bland slakterier och gårdar på landsbygden för de etiska konsekvenserna av att kasta skinnen. The Why Vetskapen om att hudarna från garverierna kastades efter slakt från mindre slakterier. Det är inte etiskt rätt mot naturen och inte heller mot djuren i Sverige och globalt att kasta hudarna efter slakt. Dessa hudar kommer från djur från mindre gårdar i Sverige, ett land som ofta räknas som att ha bland de mest progressiva djurlagarna i världen. På de mindre gårdarna är inte djurhanteringen industriell utan mer human och att döda djuren och sedan inte ta hand om hela djuret efter slakten är problematiskt. Detta gäller även slakt av djur som gått fritt i naturen som hjortar och vildsvin, där hudarna efter slakt kastas. Dessa är djur som levt ett värdigt liv ute i naturen samtidigt som djur föds upp för att slaktas i andra länder för sina skinn. Därför startades Satellitskinn.",Sweden,"9,12,13,",,,,

A change on the skin can be an early warning sign of Melanoma skin cancer. The What 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed is skin cancer and it's estimated that over 250 million people is in the high risk of developing or dying of Melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer. 1 in 5 people in the USA will develop skin cancer during their life and in Australia, it is 2 out of 3 people that will develop skin cancer. 98,3% survive melanoma and is cured if it is caught early and the single most important thing you can do actively, is to keep an eye on your skin and look for changes - either a new mark forming on your skin or as a change in an existing mole. +70% of all melanoma incidents form as a new mark on your skin and does not develop from an existing mole. Doctors are generally very good at diagnosing and assessing skin cancer, but can often not support the patient with identifying changes on your skin. Miiskin can help you with identifying changes on your skin. The How Identifying changes on your skin, remembering all of your skin’s appearance and remember to follow up on your own skin self-examinations on a regular basis is not easy without the support of technology, and this is where the Miiskin’s platform comes in. Our app helps you structure a process around your skin examinations and allows you to take and keep photos of your skin and moles for monitoring over time. It assists you in comparing photographs over time by allowing side-by-side viewing and parallel manipulation of the images. This makes it far easier for the user to identify differences between photos such as the appearance of a new mole, or a change to an existing mole. Our new Skin Mapping feature where AI and machine learning highlights all the moles and marks on your skin so you will be able to identify new marks on your skin is the first step in the direction of automatic detection of new marks and was covered by Forbes.com, https://cutt.ly/EwF4xlW The Why Miiskin was founded by Jon, who needed a better way to track the moles on his partner Rikke’s back. The doctor recommended Jon and Rikke to take photos and save them on a computer together with some written notes by pen and paper. He couldn’t help thinking that digital machine learning and photos of the moles could simplify and improve this process. 500,000 downloads and thousands of positive messages from happy users show that this is a concern many are looking to solve.

The What We are simply unable to deal with the huge amounts of plastic waste we produce and consume. Only about 25% of the household plastic waste is sorted out for recycling. In the western world, large parts of this is never actually recycled, but reach the oceans through the international plastic trade system. 70 000 containers of plastic waste was sent from Europe to Asia for recycling in 2018. Much ending up at low cost recycling facilities leaking into the oceans. Only about 9% of plastic waste is recycled. 30% reaches the oceans. Reduction of plastic is the main solution to ending the flow of plastic into our oceans. The How Indo Naturals creates exciting, and easy to adopt, everyday products, free from plastics. We do this through plant resources, in collaboration with our rural partners in India. With one of the worlds richest floras, and natural growth all year around, India is abundant in plant resources. These resources are often left unused, while millions of people living within the nature, are increasingly getting poorer. Producing plant-based products in India is a unique opportunity to reduce plastic waste from everyday consumer products, while also helping provide labor opportunities in rural India. The Why After graduating with a master in Economics I worked at the Norwegian Consulate General in Mumbai. Next to this, I volunteered at the worlds largest beach clean-up with UN champion of the Earth, Afroz Shah. Based on my background education in economics I started seeing the opportunity to utilize the vast plant-resources of rural India to create quality, zero-plastic, products while also creating labor opportunities for rural societies in poverty. I ventured into rural India and found amazing partners that produce ethically and include social programs such as women's empowerment in their production.",,"1,12,14,",,,,
2779,Fishency Innovation,https://www.fishency.no/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/fishency-innovation,"The Pitch Fishency uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to improve sustainability in the aquaculture industry The What The world needs more food and healthy food. Within 2050 the global demand for protein on our dinner plates is expected to grow by 80%, and there are fewer and fewer options to expand on land. Farmed proteins from the ocean have only a fraction of the environmental impact as farmed proteins from land-based animals. But, it needs to be as sustainable as possible, and with as little impact on the environment and life in water as possible. Norway is the biggest salmon producer in the world, however, sea lice are their major challenge. Sea lice are the reason the industry cannot grow and causes severe issues when it comes to sustainability. The spread of sea lice threatens salmon production and the environment. If allowed to reach full size, sea lice prevent fish from growing, ultimately resulting in mortality. The aquaculture industry needs high-quality data to combat sea lice spread, cut treatment costs, improve fish welfare, reduce losses and protect the environment. The How Fishency is developing a digital sea lice counting solution which we call the Smartfunnel. The SmartFunnel eliminates labor-intensive sampling methods and allows fish farmers to take a larger sample size, giving them better decision support to optimize treatment and measure the effectiveness of preventive measures. It also improves accuracy and repeatability and can increase productivity and reduce the environmental impact of fish farms. Primarily designed for sea lice counting, the solution can also be used for measuring biomass, identifying external deformities, ulcers or damage, as well as for monitoring the environment of the fish. In the future, it will have the capacity to identify individual salmon. Looking ahead, such a technology could be adapted for use with rainbow trout and potentially other farmed fish as well. The Why The co-founder Flavie Gohin joined an accelerator X2 Labs and had the chance to review the various problems the industry has to solve with the support from major actors of the aquaculture industry. When she learned how sea lice were monitored today at the farms, she just knew that there were new solutions and technologies available that could improve significantly the process for sea lice monitoring. She quickly assessed the impact of having access to highly reliable sea lice data for the industry to contribute to better prevention and prediction. Since then, she built up progressively a team who shared the same drives and passion. We are all service minded and willing to contribute actively to better technical solutions for sustainable food production from our oceans.",,"2,12,14,",,,,

We aim at becoming the world champion company in making the biggest impact on combating global warming. The What Our world is warmer than ever before. Landmark report of UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for &quot;urgent and unprecedented changes&quot; to keep global temperatures between 1.5C and 2C above the pre-industrial levels. High and ever increasing greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere not only increases global average temperature, but also disrupting the stability of the climate. If unstopped, this will result (and already does) in huge damages to the Earth's ecosystem and biosphere. This poses an existential challenge to humanity. The awareness about the problem is rising, and with it the impatient willingness to do something. But taking action against global warming looks like a daunting task, and some are discouraged by the thought of being powerless to make an impact alone. The How Taking climate action is easier than ever before. Climaider makes it easy for individuals and businesses to quickly measure their carbon footprints and to offset it through supporting verified climate change mitigation projects with a monthly subscription fee. We empower our community to become climate positive and to inspire more people to do the same. Our current projects include reforestation and a waste-to-energy project, where methane from a landfill is prevented entering the atmosphere. Simultaneously, we are engaging our subscribers to make behavioural changes, reduce their carbon footprint in their own life. Our primary internal KPI is the &quot;amount of CO2 reduced&quot;. The Why &quot;The idea came from a personal frustration with not being able to do anything about climate change. I was in the middle of the Colombian jungle building permaculture farms when I realised that doing so would not save the world. But then the idea for Climaider came - enabling individuals like myself to actually have an impact on global warming. That is why maximum impact is and will always be at the core of Climaider.&quot; - Oliver Whimster Martinsen",Frederiksberg,"12,13,",,,,
2781,Ciao Ciao Carsharing AB,https://gociaociao.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/ciao-ciao-carsharing-ab,The Pitch Enables car-owners to make money off their unused vehicles while creating a superior car rental service in terms of both price and usability for people in need of a car without owning one. The What A privately owned car is standing still 95% of the time on average and costs a lot of money for the owner. We enable the car-owner to share their vehicles with other people and increase the vehicle's utilization while also generating an income for the owner. Studies show that one car in this kind of sharing service can remove up to 15 cars from the streets in urban areas. Even if that number would be 5 that would mean significant benefits for city planning and reduce the environmental impact of producing the cars. The How We have an app-based peer-to-peer carsharing service where car owners can share their vehicles with ease. and where people in need of transport can use an app to rent a car in their neighborhood with a few taps in an app. The app manages the whole rental process without involving the car owner at all. The Why We noticed that there are so many cars in a city that is completely unused and we thought about how nice it would be if you could just borrow a car for a few hours and park it at the same place when the owner needed it without any negative impact for them. It's such a waste with all the cars that are just sitting there and costing money for their owners. We also find it extremely motivating to make it easier for other people to live more environmentally sound. If we can make 10 000 people live their lives with 5% less environmental impact that is five times as much as we would start living with zero environmental impact our selves.,,"10,11,12,",,,,

The What We are working to prevent future alcohol abuse by challenging young people to reflect on how and when they use alcohol. We also believe that if the Nordic drinking culture is more inclusive, ie no social or peer pressure, more people will choose to participate and socialize on arenas we typically associate with lots of drinking. The How We challenge students at universities and university colleges in the Nordics to take three months sober while we give them weekly tasks to explore. They share content about their experiences with friends or other students publicly through our Nattens helter platform. We target campus by campus, starting with hiring four students part time to do the challenge while the rest of the students can watch their journey through social media. After a year we introduce an app so that the majority of the students who wish to do the challenge can do so with friends and student unions. The Why We were students once. And we know that it is easy to become a high functioning alcoholic if you are part of drinking culture that encourages high consumption. We have also seen accidents happen because of it. And we have seen that students who do not consume alcohol have a hard time taking part in the social life on campus because of that very same drinking culture.",,3,People,,,

2785,BetterNow,http://www.betternow.org,https://plusimpact.io/startups/betternow-1,"The Pitch Our mission: to make the world more generous by helping charities to engage supporters in novel ways of giving and fundraising. The What The core of our story has always been a simple and clear mission: To make the world more generous. And enabling anyone to start a fundraiser is the first step to achieve this goal. We believe that if we can change the way fundraising is perceived, we can help more of the world’s wealth be donated to charities. We don’t aim at taking another slice of the donations going to charities, we want to increase the total amount of donations charities receive. The How BetterNow’s fundraising solution enables any charity to engage their supporters in peer-to-peer fundraising. At its core BetterNows solutions allow supporters of charities to speak up about their favourite cause and engage their network in fun and creative ways to fundraise. The solution is hosted and maintained by BetterNow but the charity can change the design so it matches their storytelling and branding. Our goal is that no donor or fundraiser will ever know who BetterNow is and that the charity receives the full attention. The Why Fundraising has histrionically been mostly related to printed campaigns, telemarketing, monthly printed newsletters and people fronting you in the street or knocking on your door with rattle cans. It has been surprisingly slow at moving online, maybe because the major part of donations traditionally comes from older generations. Now the new generations are online in many aspects of their lives, and thanks to the internet, information has crossed borders in a way society has not seen before. Peer-to-peer fundraising is growing with the wide use of social media, new generations seek self-realisation and ways to create their own identity outside of previous traditions and norms. Although peer-to-peer fundraising has been dominated by large giving platform, we learned donors want to engage with charities, not platforms. That's why we created BetterNow.",,10,Prosperity,,,
2786,Leafymade,http://www.leafymade.se,https://plusimpact.io/startups/leafymade,"The Pitch Leafyamde is developing disposable items to help consumers and businesses solve the issue of over reliance on paper and plastic disposables with biodegradable and sustainable alternatives. The What The problem of disposables that are made of paper, plastic, styrofoam etc.. are well known. With the increase in demand of disposable, this problem need to be tackled. According to a report, annually there are 10 million tons of plastic gets dumped in ocean. With this current trend there will be more plastics than fishes in the ocean. EU has recently passed a resolution on single use plastic ban. Also, the consumers, especially in the developed world has started demanding more sustainable products. We at Leafymade plans to target this problem by providing alternative sustainable solutions. The How Our idea is to use natural, biodegradable materials to make sustainable disposable products that can go as an organic waste after its use. This means Leafymade products leaves nothing behind. For example our tableware like disposable plates, bowls, dip bowls etc are made up of leaves and only leaves. Our product are the perfect alternate of one time disposable plates made of paper and plastics. Our products are suatainable and goes back into the nature in only 2-3 weeks without leaving any footprints on the environment. No chemical and pesticides are used in the process. It also give the impression of the step towards the sustainable future. Similarly, our another product is pots for cultivation that are made up of coconut fiber. We observed that all herbs like basil and coriander in Sweden comes in disposable plastic pots and so we developed a product that can replace them. In future, we want to develop more products. The Why A thought experiment when we traveled back in time, before the invention of paper and plastics. Humans still used disposable but they were all made of natural materials and sustainable. Then even today, there is a common practice in south Asia, where people use fresh banana leafs as disposables. So these idea lead to the existence of Leafymade project.",,"12,13,15,",,,,

2788,Panion,https://panion.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/panion-2,"The Pitch Panion improves social integration and well-being by connecting people through common interests, goals, values, and experiences. The What Loneliness is a world epidemic deadlier than obesity and is one of the leading causes of mental health issues. One obvious reason for loneliness is that people are moving to new cities and suddenly faced with the task of finding new friends from scratch. Struggles to socially integrate into a new society not only affects the people trying to integrate, but also the communities and cities in which people are moving to. The How Panion is a keyword-searchable social platform that connects like-minded people based on common interests, goals, values, and experiences. We have created an app that allows you to find like-minded people nearby by tagging your profile with keywords that best describe you and the types of people you’d like to meet. On Panion you can explore those who share your interests nearby then reach out to organize in-person meetups. The app proposes relevant activities in your area so it’s easy to turn an online interaction into a real life friendship. With a platform that focuses solely on interest and less on physical appearance, friendships can transcend socio-economic, cultural, and racial differences. Our B2B tool Panion Communities is a community-building tool that helps companies, schools, and organizations facilitate more social interactions amongst its members. The platform is entirely keyword searchable and filterable so members are able to search for each other based on common interests, values, goals or experiences and even narrow their searches by location, gender, age, language and much more. Members and admins can propose spontaneous events within the network and form social groups around an interest. Community admins are given a dashboard of analytics to track trends in their community and send segmented messages based on interest and location. The Why When I moved to Sweden 4.5 years ago to research integration at Lund University, I encountered newcomers on a daily basis struggling to meet like-minded people to rebuild their social circles. For multiple years in a row now, Sweden has been ranked the no. 1 hardest country to make new friends in Denmark is no. 2. While society encourages us to ‘fit in’, those who come from outside or who don’t fit the norm often feel isolated.

2789,Blue Lobster,https://bluelobster.app/da/hjem/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/blue-lobster-1,"The Pitch Blue Lobster is changing the way you buy seafood by allowing fishermen to sell directly to consumers via a digital direct-to-consumer app. We empower small-scale fishermen to reach a larger consumer-base and earn more for their catch, while enabling consumers to access fresh, locally caught seafood. The What The customer pain is different for the fishermen and the consumers. The pain for small- and medium-sized fishermen is that they are struggling to earn a decent living, due to their margins being continuously suppressed by the industry. The scope of this problem can be seen with many fishermen taking on part-time jobs to secure a decent income, with 41% of Danish fishermen leaving full-time employment between 2008 and 2014. There are two pains for consumers. The first pain is that the price of seafood in Denmark is very high, with 59% of Danes stating that they would like to eat more fish and the primary barrier to this being price (COOP study). The second pain is the difficulty of getting fresh seafood, where the fish currently being sold on the market is 4-16 days old. This has a huge effect on quality and taste. The How By cutting out the many middlemen of the industry, we are able to pay fishermen 3x more for their fish than the current buyers and still sell cheaper to consumers than competitors. This solves two pains: fishermen will earn liveable wage, and the produce will be affordable to the customers. Further, by locally sourcing we eliminate the need for extensive transportation and are able to deliver seafood on the same day it is caught, addressing the second consumer pain. The value proposition is therefore monetary for both parts, as well as delivering a higher quality (fresher) product than any competitor. Being based on technology, we are the first actors in the industry that creates full transparency into the source of the seafood, which is especially of interest to our B2B customers that can use these details for their own quality control and story-telling to their consumers. The Why We noticed that fresh fish is nearly impossible to come-by in Denmark, despite the fact this it is a country surrounded more than 8,000 km of coastline. And even the fish that is available, which is on average 4 days and up to 16 days old, is quite expensive. Meanwhile, the small-scale fishermen are struggling to survive in the industry. But it doesn't have to be this way. I used to spend my childhood summers in Maine, where we would buy fresh lobster directly from the local fishermen. It was fresh, cheap, and we were able to form a relationship and get to know the fishermen. We were surprised that there was no good solution to these problems on the marked. So we decided to start Blue Lobster to create a solution to simultaneously benefit the fishermen, the consumers, and the environment.",København,"8,12,13,",,,,

The What 100x growth is expected in battery use in the coming decades due to electric vehicle and new energy generation technologies (e.g. wind and solar) if batteries are able to overcome the four key problems of Lithium-ion batteries limiting uptake: high cost, long charging time, low energy capacity, limited scalability and flammability. BroadBit is uniquely able to overcome all these key barriers to growth. BroadBit literally enables the electrification of transportation and the uptake of intermittent energy sources to replace fossil fuels. The How BroadBit's batteries are uniquely based on sodium chloride (table salt), enabling exceptionally high power and energy, low material and manufacturing costs and safe and stable performance by avoiding the costly and dangerous failure modes of Li-ion batteries. No other commercial battery technology uses sodium chloride as the active material. Our advantages compared to Lithium-ion are: 1) 50% higher energy per cost 2) 25% higher energy per weight 3) More environmentally friendly, scalable and sustainable 4) Simpler, open air manufacturing 5) Safer (non flammable, no risk of overcharging) 6) More durable (no risk of undercharging, 2x the operating temperature range: -20 to +60C) The Why We started the company to solve the last remaining problems to the mass market update of wind and solar energy and electric vehicles: insufficient energy density, high cost, limited raw materials, and poor safety of existing batteries. After thinking and experimenting for several years, we developed our high performance, cheap, scalable and safe solution. Once that was verified with several third parties, we founded the company to change the world.",,7,Prosperity,,,

There is a massive need for education and training in healthcare. New medical treatments should be mastered by the medical staff, existing treatments by new doctors and nurses. Everyone is on schedule and time is scarce. New training methods must be introduced to avoid malpractice. Alteruna has developed TeamSimulator to help surgeons and nurses train more and better. It is a virtual reality platform (VR) where operating teams, individually or together, can train technical skills like procedures and team-skills like cooperation. The company is now rapidly entering other areas of medical treatment training like heart stop (CPR) and Triage (to mark and select patients in war, accidents and pandemics like covid 19). Alteruna has developed a training platform using gaming technology and VR. Using it teams and individuals will be immersed in a virtual copy of their physical environment, interacting with purely digital objects or a mix of physical and digital objects. It is a long time since I had a day job. I have been an entrepreneur most of my professional life. The South General Hospital of Stockholm (Södersjukhuset) approached me and asked if we could combine VR and haptic robots. We said yes and showed them a proof of concept. With some grants we developed demonstrator of the project. This is what we like, to engage in a project in its true sense; you know where you, you know where you aim but the path is unknown and you most likely will end up somewhere else.

2796,Loop Rocks,https://www.looprocks.se/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/loop-rocks-1,"The Pitch Saving money and the environment by reusing materials within the construction industry The What The construction industry stands for 30-40 % of all waste produced and the efficiency is low. Society has three main environmental challenges that we try to help solve: decreasing the carbon emissions by decreasing the need for transportation by 75%, eliminating the need for landfill by reusing materials instead of throwing materials away and enabling traceability for all materials transported. The How Loop Rocks is an open platform where our 15 000+ construction companies can find or get rid of stone materials, gravel, or soil. The users of Loop Rocks exchange more than 3 million tonnes of materials every year and we are growing by about 10% every month.

We’re doing that by creating innovative sustainable products and building a community that celebrates and supports environmental activism. The What We are working to help solve SDG12, SDG13 and SDG17, however when we started Organic Basics the Impact goals had not yet been revised. We are focusing on having a positive environmental impact, as we see the current climate crisis as the core problem to solve, as none of the other impact goals will be relevant if we don't solve the current climate challenge. In Organic Basics we believe that its a million bad decisions that got us to climate crisis that we are currently experiencing and its a million better decisions that will get us out of this challenge. Through education on our online platforms and a authentic curiosity on sustainable development, our partners, manufacturers, employees and customers are learning how to be better consumers together with us. The How The word sustainability is becoming an ever bigger buzz word, so we are making sure always to make our approach to sustainability, tangible. We have created a business model where sustainability is the growth driver, and not a direct cost as many other companies tend to think about it. To make sure that we always get closer to our mission and to measure our green growth, we have implemented a sustainability roadmap. Which is a roadmap for all the green initiatives we want to improve in Organic Basics on a 5 year horizon, mapped out year by year, month by month. Sustainbility is a process, a way of working and optimizing to limit our ressources, the day we stop, is the day Organic Basics die. The Why There is no planet B, we wanted to create a sustainable business in the second most poluting industry that could help inspire other business to follow our footsteps. To truly understand sustainability, you have to be a tree-hugger and a nature lover. In the founding team this is exactly what we are. Christoffer being a scout for 15 years and now spending every vacation in a shelter or on a mountain, Alex being a climber always seeking new mountains to climb, and Mads loving the ocean wether its on a boat or under water. We wanted to work with something that could have a positive impact on the current mass extinsion on biodiversity, which is the 6 in earths history but the first caused by humans.

2798,Aqsens Health Oy,http://www.aqsens.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/aqsens-health-oy,"The Pitch Aqsens Health has developed non-invasive and patented E-TRF method for health analysis. As a method it is accurate, quick and mobile with low costs of deployment, which makes it an ideal solution for preventive health screening. Especially for developing economies. The What Due to the continuous increase of healthcare costs we have to change the way we think and how to take preventive actions into agenda of national health issues - those actions will require new innovative healthtech and preventive funding mechanism like ""Result Based Financing"" (SIB models). AQH’s E-TRF method is highly versatile and it works with any human body liquid, saliva, urine or microbiota. Key application are Oral Cancer (India), Prostate Cancer (Finland / India / Mexico) and Preterm birth (EU project filed) but method can detect many other diseases as well. In India where we are working with the Public Health Foundation of India (www.phfi.org) and Ministry of Biotechnology to have over 100 00 saliva based oral cancer and anaemia tests done by 2020 with the target of getting our solution to be served millions in India. The How Aqsens Q-System consists of a reader, testkit (consumable) and intelligent algorithm on a tablet / laptop. With a low cost and ease of use / manage solution it can scale preventive health screening for masses. Being a non-invasive method it will not require basically any medical education nor laboratory conditions. The Why Initially I was intrigued by novelty of the innovation, core technology and key people working with it. Later when I realised healthcare challenges faced by our society, but especially in developing economies, I decided to put my full energy and competence to turn the fundamental idea to a reality. In addition eye opening visits to hospitals in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Mexico (Guadalajara) and several places (hospitals / villages) guided tours to slums) in India with NGO's (Vijayawada, Lucknow, Bangalore, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi) has further strengthen my view on how important new healthtech innovation and respective funding mechanisms are.",,3,People,,,

2800,Blue Lice AS,http://www.bluelice.no,https://plusimpact.io/startups/blue-lice-as,"The Pitch Blue Lice switches focus from treatment to prevention of sea lice. Its system acts like a mosquito trap, attracting, capturing and containing sea lice before they reach the salmon. The What The global need for protein is growing. Salmon is an excellent source of animal protein, with a relatively small carbon footprint. The Norwegian authorities have set a goal to increase production five-fold by 2050. Sea lice, however, pose the greatest challenge to achieving this goal. The parasite feeds on salmon’s skin and tissue, making the fish more prone to infection, trauma and stress. In 2016 alone, 53 million salmon died in their pens in Norwegian fish farms, mostly due to sea lice. Treatment costs for fish farmers are estimated at USD 1.3 billion annually (excluding revenue losses). The How Blue Lice’s patent pending system consists of physical units which are placed around a fish farming pen. Each unit is a trap that lures in sea lice through a combination of attractors and then contains them. The system takes advantage of the sea lice’s instincts by amplifying attractors, light and odorant, making the trap more attractive than the salmon. Preventing sea lice from entering fish farms in the first place minimises the need for treatment, which often involves stressful fish handling or potentially harmful drugs or chemicals. Use of Blue Lice’s system in combination with other measures such as cleaner fish will keep the number of sea lice below permitted limits. Blue Lice’s solution improves fish welfare as well as product quality and production rate. The system is cost effective, scalable and sustainable. It is also non-invasive to fish and does not interfere with daily fish farm operations. The Why Blue Lice wish to contribute to an important industry for Norway, to go in front in animal welfare and to contribute to feeding the world. The only way forward, is the sustainable way. Blue Lice strongly believe the solution is to switch the focus from treatment to prevention of sea lice to get a healthy growth of the industry and to meet the future global need for food.",,"2,12,14,",,,,

We are creating a machine learning tool to analyze popular culture based on biases, stereotypes and norms. The What Our mission is to create an inclusive and diverse media industry. The problem is that we are getting used to biases and stereotypes in media. We are not even thinking about it, but imagine what impact it might have on our opinions, self-esteem and understanding of the world. Only 30% of the speaking roles in movies are female, and far less than 1% of movies are directed by a person of color. The How We want to do this with data driven analysis of media content. We are developing an ""Equality API"" where clients can input files and get diversity based outputs. Our first algorithm generated speaking time between men and women. Also, when we cross reference this data with ROI, amount of viewers and target group appeal we can look at trends and we have seen a correlation between diversity and profit. The Why During the #metoo peek our CEO wanted to hold a speech about inequalities on her workplace (a big swedish bank), but got refused due to company politics. This made her realize that she would rather work for equality, than for the bank. And the first seed of what was going to be Ceretai was planted. Equality is a big subject, and one can not do all, but we have choosen to focus on the media industry. This because we believe that it hold a huge role when it comes to us consumers building opinions and normalizing inequalities. What if our children could grow up with relatable role models?

Today, only 1 in 4 parents to deaf children in high-income countries manage to learn sign language. In low-income countries, it is believed to be less than 1 in 10. Families with individuals that benefit from sign-assisted communication face the same challenge. These include the parents to children with Down Syndrome, severe autism or Cerebral palsy. The How An international learning platform for sign languages and sign-assisted communication. The SignLab learning platform is fully digital and can incorporate new languages within weeks. The user only needs access to a smartphone or a computer. The platform makes it fun and easy to learn through gamification and timed encouragement. To ensure that the user gets the most out of every learning session, our review functionality incorporates an AI that knows what signs you are about to forget. The AI then designs a learning session that is tailored to the individual user’s need. Our curriculum is designed in cooperation with sign language teachers in each language. The platform launched in open beta in Norway November 2018. Feedback from parents and sign language teachers gave it a NPS of +64. The platform saw exponential growth with an average growth rate of 276% each month for the first three months (Nov-Feb). This growth all came from word of mouth, $0 spent on marketing. The Why Today less than 10% of the 64 million parents to deaf and hard of hearing children know sign language due to the low availability of education centers. Exclusion from communication have a significant impact on everyday life, causing feelings of loneliness, isolation, and frustration. The inability to properly communicate have a significantly adverse effect on the academic performance of children. SignLab works towards a society where all families have access to teaching themself, their children and their community signs and sign language so that everyone can feel included.",Oslo,"3,4,10,",,,,

The number of overweight or obese infants and young children (aged 0 to 5 years) increased from 32 million globally in 1990 to 41 million in 2016. The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30% higher than that of developed countries. If current trends continue the number of overweight or obese infants and young children globally will increase to 70 million by 2025. Consequences of obesity in childhood Obese children are more likely to develop a variety of health problems as adults. These include:cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance (often an early sign of impending diabetes), musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis - a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints), some cancers (endometrial, breast and colon), disability. The How We make wholesome food for kids – naturally. Our products are made to decrease kid's daily excess calorie intake and increase daily dietary fibre intake. We make juices, smoothies and breakfast cereals that are low in sugar and high in fibre without any artificial sweeteners and other unnecessary additives. All products are developed together with medical doctors in Finland and also Helsinki university scientists (who are experts in food technology and nutrition). We take a holistic approach and want also to empower parents and motivate kids to do more physical activity, sleep better and spend more time with people instead of screens. The Why We had our own ad agency focused on FMCG brands. We worked with many international and domestic brands e.g. Coca Cola, Nestle, Unilever, Snickers, Mountain Dew, etc.. After we had kids, we realized we would do anything so that they would have the best possible start in life.

It does so by developing an electronic shopping list using voice recognition and photos, with the option of purchasing cooking videos made with this particular target audience in mind. The What SDG - 10.2: In 2030, social, economic and political inclusion of all strengthened and promoted, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status. Our app helps people with special disabilities and in the social field so they can become more independent in their daily lives. As a side effect, being able to cook after video recipes will contribute to increased health of the individual user. The How Many in the target group are not able to write / read their own shopping list or follow a food recipe. They can use intuitive tools (such as tablets and smartphones). We will take advantage of this and thereby help them become more independent, gain greater confidence and feel more free. They want to feel like others who do not have a disability. The app will help target group so they can create an electronic shopping list, using only voice recognition and photos, and make easy dishes for video recipes, without being able to read and write. The Why One of our team members (Birgitte) who is a specialized teacher, has developed and tested the idea of approx. 20 students, who eg are diagnosed autists. They find it difficult to make their own shopping list and follow cooking videos. She used physical pictograms and homemade videos. Her students use them today.

The lack of greenery impacts people mentally, causing negative mood, health problems and lack of productivity. The custom solutions for greenery in spaces are expensive and flexible, their production is time and resource demanding and often outsourced. SDG3: - stress generating space in working/ living environment, - air pollution SDG4: - poor sustainable awareness SDG11: -dense city environment, lacking greenery SDG:12 - wasteful production method with high energy inputs - short lasting products - outsourced mass production The How SDG 4. Squarely is determined to contribute to quality education for youngsters. To do so, we collaborate with KEA, AAU, and CBS. SDG 11. Outdoor plants enhance outdoor spaces as well as air quality. Placing plants outdoors and maintaining them contributes to the greening of streets and cities as well as helps communities to become more sociable and connected. SDG 12. Squarely products are developed within the circular economy framework. SDG 17. Creating collaborations is been key for Squarely's success. We have created partnerships that allow the company to have a broader network that contributes to other SDGs. The Why My biggest motivation was to create greener spaces that will positively impact people. Working for 7 years as an architect specialized in sustainable buildings I experienced the growing need for not only energy efficient sustainable solutions, technically well performing, but even more - for those tangible natural elements in users proximity. I learned that nowadays we spend 90% of our time indoors missing the connection to greenery, I researched the indoor climate and its impact on people's well being and I found proving the benefits of plants. That all led to my decision of starting the company to create smart, high-quality, sustainable designs for greenery. The products that will encourage people to grow more plants, help the architects to decorate the space easily due to the modularity. In the same, I had an ambition to do more than just great - design create an environmentally friendly, low-cost supply chain.",,"3,11,12,",,,,

The What Global climate warming is reality. Energy consumption in the world will increase. One study showed that if the energy consumption of industry would decrease by 3% climate warming would be stopped. Renewal energy sources are been studied but the efficiency of those equipments is too low to be a real solution of energy consumption growth. The How More than 10 years of research has enabled Spindeco Technologies Oy to create a conductor which utilises normal charge carriers together with polarised electrons. The coating that enables the polarisation is applied on the conductor via an electrochemical process. The coating was developed together with the University of Eastern Finland‘s (UEF) Department of Applied Physics. The process has been made ready for production in collaboration with UEF and it is scalable for various types of conductors from the microampere class to power current applications.

The What With our Home rehabilitation model we have been able to TRIPLE therapeutic resources and make results in rehabilitation recovery with chronic patients that have not been possible with old methods. This solves a part of the largest problems in the healthcare field: lack of resources, measurements and inefficiency. This technology is now transferred through research studies to health care regions in Finland. The How We are completely changing the way therapy process works. In our model, VR-based rehabilitation is initiated in the central hospital. Patients receive rehabilitation in face to face therapy and, with VR, also during the weekends and off hours. Rehab is continued in rehab centers and outpatient care. Finally, personalized rehab programs are delivered to the patients in home care using Peili VR solution. The different stakeholders of the complete rehab process know what is done and why. Central hospitals may diagnose patients easier and the rehab program can effortlessly be changed after one rehab period. Peili Vision offers the VR technology, maintenance and consultation in the service model. The Why We faced the problem of inefficient therapy practices and insufficient resources in rehabilitation. Finland has one of the best acute care systems in the world but the following rehabilition process cannot reach the same levels of excellence. Due to these challenges in terms of resources and methods, not all patients are receiving the amount of rehabilitation they would require and some are being left completely without support.

The What We believe the throwaway culture that has emerged undermines the real value of fashion. Our closets are full of items we don't wear. Creating new clothes is a costly process both in terms of the environmental cost of producing fabric material, and in terms of labour cost of production. At the same time, fashion is meant to be enjoyed. We need to think differently and be smarter in the way we consume clothes, particularly in developed countries where abundance is becoming an environmental challenge. Through Swancy we promote sustainability through reuse and give people a chance to make use of the resources they have. The How Swapping is a win-win situation and one of the most sustainable and economical ways to enjoy fashion. Our aim is therefore to make swapping available for everyone at all times. We wish to inspire people to invest in quality rather than quantity. Sustainable and ethically produced products tend to be more expensive. Swancy provides a way for people to focus on quality while still having the freedom to experiment with their style. The Why We personally love swapping and find that both receiving and giving away preloved items sparks a lot of joy. Swancy's founder was inspired by the Nordic Swap Day, organised in Norway by Naturvernforbundet. She wanted to create a swap-option that was available throughout the year. When we started doing our market research the depth of the environmental and ethical challenges facing the fashion world were quickly revealed.

And trough a platform that makes it possible for smaller producers to sell local produce without the usual marketing, distribution and sales cost (backed by behavioral data) directly to consumers with an increased profit compared to existing alternatives. The Why In spite of 10+ years of leading roles within the e-commerce and SAAS space and in both growth companies and global giants such as IBM and eBay, I am still an entrepreneur at heart. due to a number of circumstances, such as being a foodie, the father of to two girls at 3 and 7, having just finished a strategy project at eBay based on platform strategy thinking, getting the right exit opportunity, meeting up with a guy that had spent almost two years visiting small local food producers and being fascinated by a shift in consumer behavior an idea of a new company with a new business model emerged.

We will: 1- Decentralize food production & distribution with our innovative Smart Automatic Functional Food (e.g. yogurt) Machine (SDG 12) 2- Empower health with our innovative ultra-personalized functional pods (technology currently being scientifically validated) (SDG 3) 3- Power the creation of sustainable food culture (SDG 11). The How We are developing a smart automatic machine to produce personalized functional foods at home (e.g. a Nespresso for yogurts). We are starting with yogurt, a food product which is part of our food culture as a healthy go-to alternative for breakfast and snacks. Most of the yogurt available in the supermarket are not healthy or nutritious, containing high amounts of sugar and food additives/ preservatives (generally as hidden ingredients), extended shelf life (up to 30 days old!) and also contributing to the production of disposable plastic packaging. Our product is based on innovative patent-pending technology in both the devices and pods (which is currently being developed in partnership with Chalmers and Lund University in Sweden). The Why Three years ago I watched a video from the American researcher Caleb Harper (TED Talk ""This Computer Will Grow Your Food in the Future"" ) which shared the information that the average time that takes for fruits and veggies to reach supermarkets since harvesting in the US is 11 months. This information blew my mind, making me realize how little I knew about the food that we eat, and how problematic our food system is. From that moment I decided that I would dedicate my time and work to change this situation spreading knowledge about food and empowering consumers with innovative products which could both decentralize and optimize food production and consumption. And that's where the idea of YOGUT came from. By bringing ""science to the kitchen"" we want to contribute to the creation of the food of the future: food products which are healthy and sustainable, and that can contribute to a balanced and happy lifestyle.",,"3,11,12,",,,,

The What Global warming has become a major concern for the entire world. In the last few decades, environmental impact of the petrol run vehicles, along with the rising oil prices, has led to a massive interest in electric transportation among the people. The world that we live in, is now counting record-high CO2 levels every minute. And, that’s resulting in the rising temperature. Conventional combustion vehicles produce toxic gases that are affecting the health of more than a million people every year. The How EQUAON is a mobility sharing company with the aim to provide effortless hardware and software solutions for smart cities / mobility operators. The company initiated its operations in Helsinki, Finland with the team of part-time core team members. We have developed high-quality electric scooters that will push the world’s transition to the green sustainable transportation. The Why Our journey started from a dream to make some small good things happen in this world today, so that we could abundantly rejoice in it tomorrow. We welcome every day with a continuous motion and willingness to improve, and to try new directions. That is why we strived to create vehicles that could make our motion a happy one, and prompt ecological thinking. One of our key goals since the very start was to stimulate people to rely on ecological means of transport. This is very important for our future!",,11,Prosperity,,,
2814,Ingmar,http://ingmar.app,https://plusimpact.io/startups/ingredientmatcher-int-ab-1,"The Pitch Ingmar is an app that shows you the recipes you can make with the ingredients you already have at home. The What Since the app encourages people to use the ingredients they already have in order to cook new and inspiring recipes, it naturally helps in reducing food waste in each household. The situation today for many is that a lot of food items are just sitting in peoples pantries and fridges until they get spoiled and need to be thrown away. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of imagination and inspiration on what meals that can be made with those ingredients, especially on weeknights. The app also helps people to eat more varied and healthier thus helping to improve the health of each individual. People buying prepared grocery bags (matkassar) are solving their problem of not knowing what new recipes they can cook during weeknights. But another problem arises when you are sent ingredients you don't like or that you don't like cooking with so you'll end up with 3 packages of bulgur in your pantry. Ingmar can offer a far more sustainable solution than &quot;matkassarna&quot; The How By containing your list of what ingredients you have at home, the app is able to match which recipes that can be made as well as display recipes where you are only missing a few ingredients. It can also suggest what additional ingredients you should buy to be able to cook the most number of recipes. Since most people shop ingredients they are familiar with it is fairly quick and easy to keep your inventory updated. Especially if you use the built in smart shopping list that automatically fills up what you have. And if you use the recipes in the app you can easily update if you ran out of anything. The Why It all started when I was staring into my fridge looking at all the ingredients and was hoping for inspiration to cook something for dinner. Usually there are a couple of ingredients that are soon to expire so I wanted to use them but I didn't want to go out to shop new groceries. I wanted to cook something with the ingredients I already had at home. The thought then struck me that instead of searching and scrolling through recipes to find something you like, it would be a much better process to first only see the recipes that you can actually make with the ingredients you have at home, then choose from that much more narrow set of recipes. I searched for an app or service that did this but could not find any that did it well. So I started to investigate the market, the potential and possible solutions. After that I just could not stop thinking about it and that I would probably wonder for the rest of my life &quot;what if...&quot;",Sweden,"3,12,",,,,

We focus on goal 12 responsible consumption and production by facilitating and keeping track of the maintenance of merchant vessel and its maintenance. This platform are providing tools to keep track of your efforts towards more sustainable maritime industry. The How By facilitating the use of components used in the circular flow by providing an digital ecosystem used by shipowners and equipment suppliers. We incorporate a set of tools and functionality that tracks the use and rewards shipowners that use componenets that have more than one cycle documented in the system. The Why I have been working in the maritime industry on both the ship owner, logistics provider and the equipment manufacturer for several years.

2816,Wavers by SundhedsDanmark IVS,https://wavers.io,https://plusimpact.io/startups/wavers,"Wavers is developed as a result of the challenges with mental health that workplaces are faced with today. Mental illness is increasingly prevalent, and The National Research Center for the Working Environment (NFA) estimates that the direct and indirect societal costs of mental problems are 55 billion Danish kroner (approx. 8 billion USD). Sadly, the corona crisis has certainly not contributed positively to this trend. The crisis generates huge insecurity for companies and their employees and can potentially trigger mental problems such as anxiety, stress and depression. We have just released our app “Wavers” which is supported by the union “the Velliv Association.” Wavers is a dynamic health platform that detects and prevents problems and challenges at workplaces before it turns into serious problems. Read more about Wavers and watch a short video that explains the app here: https://wavers.io/ The unique about Wavers is that it starts with the employees. Through our app, employees are urged and motivated to take responsibility for their own and their colleagues’ wellbeing by answering questions (that can be asked by everyone), while maintaining their anonymity, until the unique reach out-feature is used which gives the unsatisfied person the opportunity to accept a helping hand from another colleague. Therefore, the workplace’ mental health becomes a shared project and responsibility for all employees. As a result of this, we hope that Wavers can help create a culture based on constant care and support at workplaces around the World, starting in Denmark.

2817,Healstack,http://www.healstack.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/healstack,"The Pitch Healstack is AI-powered health app helping women overcome disordered eating and obesity. The What There is 1.9 billion people in the world who are overweight. Currently available tools are not working, especially fad diets. Therefore, we are challenging the diet industry and the global obesity epidemic by introducing a new way to manage weight. Our vision is to get 1 million women to stop fad dieting forever and instead embrace a balanced lifestyle by managing their habits and hunger cues instead of obsessing over food elimination and calorie counting. Women are heavily targeted by the diet industry, keeping them in the loop of not only unhealthy eating behaviors but low self-esteem. In its core, Healstack is tailored for people who struggle with disordered eating patterns and have previously failed to lose weight using conventional methods. Even though we focus on women at this stage, it is ideal for anyone who wants to re-balance their relationship with food, cheaper, easier and with long-term sustainability. The How To achieve our goal, we are introducing HungerQ - a hunger algorithm that helps stabilize and improve hunger cues for those who are unable to “hear their body” properly, due to years of dieting, disordered eating, and food restriction. We draw our learnings from eating disorder recovery research and root our principles in overcoming conditions like Binge Eating Disorder. In addition, with AI we are benchmarking healthy and unhealthy behaviors to recognize disordered patterns early on and apply recommendations that will help empower the individual to create new coping skills instead of food. The Why We built Healstack because we have recognized the need for people (especially women) to receive help with their disordered eating. Currently, in many countries the medical help is expensive, doctors are not familiar with disorders like BED and there is a deep-rooted stigma as well as fat-phobia. This idea was a way of finding a solution after one of our founders wasn't able to get help. Through research & tech exploration we found a combination that works which we tested with users. It helped our research participants. Once we saw the huge change it made, it was a no-brainer to keep up.",,3,People,,,

The What We will generate energy out of waste (affordable and clean energy(7)). The company will add new waste management infrastructure (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure (9)). And we prevent litter and waste on land and in the ocean. (Life below water (14)) and (life on land (15)). And will at the end create new jobs (decent work and economic growth (8)). The How We want to use capacity on international dockyards with leading suppliers from Europe to build floating waste-to-energy power plants. This will build up local waste management capacity. We will focus on incineration and anaerobic digestion to generate energy. As both are proven tech to solve waste and generated energy. And connect the vessel to the local power grid to sell our electricity. The Why We believe that the plastic waste entering our ocean is the ozone problem of our time. It is a lot of media, but we believe cleaning up at beaches and in the ocean is far too late. We want to prevent the waste from entering the ocean in the first place. The environment, living creatures, and people are suffering from the amounts of waste that are not being handled in a proper way.",,"7,9,14,",,,,
2819,Flaskefond,http://www.flaskefond.no,https://plusimpact.io/startups/flaskefond-1,"The Pitch Flaskefond is the worlds first impact-investment fund based on proceeds from deposit bottles. We help business recycle, and together, we support startups working with UN's SDG's The What Flaskefond is directly involved with SDG 12 and 17. By motivating business to recycle deposit bottles, we establish partnerships that have an immediate impact on the responsible consumption of bottled products. Indirectly, Flaskefond is also working the remaining SDG's. By taking the deposit proceeds and investing them in impact driven technology startups, our work touches SDG 1 - 17. The How Each year, and despite having the worlds most advanced return system, Norwegians throw away over 150 million deposit bottles. A percentage of these disappear at offices and public buildings. Flaskefond motivates business to start recycling deposit bottles by (a) offering aesthetic collection furniture (b) picking up recycled bottles directly form partners and (c) involving partners in the investment process. The Why Flaskefond was started by Niklas during Holmenkollen Festival back in 2016. He saw that tens of thousands of soda and beer cans were being sold but not recycled. As the clever man he is, he approached the organizer and together, they set up provisional recycling stations. Within 2 days, Flaskefond collected 25.000 bottles, meaning 25.000kr. This was the proof of concept and realization that this was a problem that could easily and profitably be solved. The 25.000kr were partly donated to several causes and the rest used to design a new type of collection furniture made from old oil drums. Infinitum loved the idea and has since supported us with their logistics operation. During the spring of 2018, Niklas brought along Mats and Mons as co-founders to help realize Flaskefond. Today, Flaskefond collect far over 100.000 bottles a year, are growing slowly but steadily and have supported four impact driven start-ups with deposit bottle proceeds.",,"9,12,",,,,

Volunteers from companies visit school classes and take on study visits. Our app makes it possible for youth to get contacts with different professions. The Why Youth unemployment is a major challenge in low-income areas. Teenagers often lack adult role models with jobs to inspire them. They have seldom met people from the offices, they have never been to an office and do not know about jobs, what would suit them and how do you get there. Many companies have a lack of skilled labour. Staff want to engage in social sustainability. The How - Volunteer class coaches from different companies visit a class 3-4 times per year, 2 hours per session. A team of 3-4 volunteers from different employers, visit the same group of 15-25 students. - The team of volunteers get an agenda with engaging activities from My Dream Now on what to do and say in class. Examples of agendas with different themes: Start dreaming - create a collage with pictures representing your dreams, How to behave at a job interview - role play. How to apply for jobs? - Companies take on study visits, groups of 15 students, two hour visit.

2821,Worldish,http://www.worldish.se,https://plusimpact.io/startups/worldish,"The Pitch Worldish helps healthcare professionals and patients communicate over their language barriers through a digital tool called 'Helen'. The What Improved accessability to Healthcare. Higher patient safety for foreign patients. Higher equality in healthcare. We also reduce healthcare's dependency on unqualified interpreters and adhoc interpreters. This helps healthcare providers and the state to reduce their cost on interpretation. Helen is a quality assured medical translation support tool that assures safe and reliable translations. Helen also digitalizes the communication between healthcare professionals and patients, and it has automated digital reporting. This helps healthcare professionals save time in documentation. The How We have developed a product called 'Helen', which is digital interpretation tool. Helen operates as a SAAS product that runs on various platforms, typically on electronic tablets. Helen assures medically accurate communication and translations. Helen is built from vast libraries of medical science and aids healthcare professionals to communicate over different care procedures and routines. Helen uses visual, audio and text-based technologies to enable cross-cultural communication between care givers and patients. The Why We as founders faced language barriers ourselves as new comers in Sweden in 2014. We felt isolated in the society and wanted to be more integrated and united into the community here. That led us to write down our vision.. 'We foresee a world where language does not separate people'. That's how Worldish came to be. We knew that we had to be better than Google Translate and the other free apps out there. The only way to do that was to have relentless focus on specific situations. We realized that patients could not receive quality healthcare everyday because of language barriers. As health is the most important priority for human well-being, we set foot into healthcare and decided that safe healthcare communication would be our primary focus and mission.",,"3,10,",,,,
2822,Provement,http://www.provement.io/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/provement-1,"The Pitch A solution for data driven childhood obesity treatment. Families with obese children collect data at home with a smartphone application and connected devices. We analyze data to facilitate more effective and efficient treatment. Effect has been verified in a RCT and clinical practice. The What Childhood obesity has many negative effects including: reduced academic performance, lower expected income, increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and overall reduced quality of life. The risks are normalized by successful weight loss. There is immense potential for personal and societal cost savings even if the individuals regain weight and become obese again as adults. Today the global prevalence of childhood obesity is around 5 % and much higher in most parts of the developed world. In the EU only about 10 % of obese children receive treatment. The How Provement is a software platform that connects families with obese children to treatment clinics. Patients/families collect data in their own home with a smartphone application and connected devices. The data is analyzed to set targets and give some feedback directly to the patients/families but our USP is that we give health care professionals better tools that allow them to treat more patients with better results given the same resources. We give clinics a tool to provide effective and cost efficient childhood obesity treatment. The Why We have people in our team who has worked with childhood obesity for a long time and understand the need for better tools to give to the health care professionals that work with the disease. We are close to the problem and realize how big impact we can have. The effects of successful weight loss are not only noticeable short term, but affects the entire life of the people we manage to help.",,3,People,,,

Our brands count some of the world's most recognisable luxury fashion houses, including Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermès. The What From the very beginning, we have been dedicated to improving the health of our planet. By recycling high quality products; we work towards limiting a global carbon footprint, minimising counterfeits and honoring great craftsmanship in the process. ""Fast fashion"" is not just unethical due to the strain it imposes on the human resources involved; it is upsetting the ecological balance and depletes our natural resources, flora and fauna. The How We believe that good craftsmanship is a celebration of a collective culture. By approaching quality as an intrinsic value, we aim to offer a real alternative to buying new. Simoultaneously educating people through quality content, we aim to increase awareness about the benefits of recycling high-end luxury items. Through our proven ecosystem which rewards customers when buying, selling and recycling used luxury; THEBROWNPAPERBAG is poised to expand and include more product groups and engage in new markets. The Why We were baffled by the seemingly never-ending stream of luxury handbags entering the market and flooding the streets. Where did they come from? Were they authentic? And what happened to them after they had been used? Thus THEBROWNPAPERBAG was born out of a need for increased recycling in tandem with accessibility and an absolute guarantee on authenticity.",,"8,12,13,",,,,
2824,Snappcar,http://www.snappcar.se,https://plusimpact.io/startups/snappcar-2,"The Pitch SnappCar is well on its way to become the leading peer-to-peer carsharing community in Europe. Within its community thousands of car owners share their personal cars with tens of thousands of neighbors and friends, all of those looking for a more social, durable and cheaper alternative. The What By sharing cars with each other a few things are solved at once. First of all congestion decreases as a shared car is estimated to replace around 8-10 renters according to research. This also is connected parking, where the same metrics apply. The second impact of car sharing is that car sharing decreases the demand for newly produced cars. This is done by not only decreasing demand for the actual cars, but research also shows that car sharers decrease their mobility need over time, so behaviour (not only need for car) is positively impacted. The How Our mission is to have 5 million fewer cars in Europe by 2022, with more space and decreased CO2 emissions as a result. The more cars we share with each other, the less cars we need. The way we want to solve this is to grow as much as we can and make more cars sharable. To make that possible we continuously work with making the sharing process more smooth (by e.g. tech) and also by improving terms and conditions for both parties. The Why To be honest? It's a fun, but hard challange. Most of us who work here are driven by the impact car sharing has for cities at the core. Having that said, emission impact does take time and is tracked on the long term. On the short term, we are driven by the social impact (which is harder to track) in terms of seeing people meet and relate to each other who otherwise wouldn't.",,"11,12,",,,,

Our first product is a hydroponic vase that enables everyone to grow their own food on the windowsill, and green thumbs are not needed. The What We want to minimize the environmental impact our products have, and reduce or leave out hazardous chemicals, and minimize toxic waste. We want to reduce the food waste and reduce the amount of petrol-based materials used in production. We want to bring people closer to nature and give them knowledge of what their are eating. The How We have been looking into using ""ocean plastic"" for our production, which is made from plastic that have been cleaned from the ocean. We also want to move production to Europe when possible, which reduces transports. We are making sure our products do not contain anything hazardous, for instance BPA or phthalates. Our product brings people closer to nature, which we think is important in times where more people move into cities and loose touch with nature. Growing your own food also leads to less transports and the possibility for people to know exactly what they are eating, since they have grown it themself without pesticides or excessive fertilizers. The Why We are passionate about plants and growing your own food. We love making products that solve real problems and work with user-centric design. We think hydroponics is needed to make urban gardening more efficient and user friendly. In our studies, we have observed that people usually want to have plants at home but often lack time, skills or interest to keep them alive and growing.",,"3,12,",,,,
2826,ihopa,http://www.ihopa.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/ihopa-1,"The Pitch ihopa has developed a digital platform that makes shared ownership easy, secure and accessible. The What Co-owning is far from being a new concept and much more established than you might think - assets such as boats, caravans and summerhouses have long being shared within families and neighbourhoods. However, trends such as reallocation, urbanisation and the increase in single households cause a decline of these traditional sharing setups and lead to the need for new concepts. In the recent years we have already seen the first spikes of this changing user behaviour from buying and owning to sharing and renting. This trend will continue driven by millenials that understand the potential of sharing goods and economists say that the sharing will have a big impact on our economy. Co-owning is a powerful and sustainable solution, but comes with challenges such as scheduling, fairness, security and maintenance. Today co-owners typically use various unsuitable tools, such as google calendar, emails, sms, forums, etc. to manage their shared ownerships. The How We've built a dedicated digital platform that is tackling the main pain-points of shared ownership, such as: * Matchmaking * Co-owning agreement * Smart scheduling * Communication * Fair maintenance * Logs * Insurance * and several more tooling in development By making all of this available in one place, the administration and collaboration of shared ownership becomes much easier, including the finding of new co-owners. We're opening up a world of possibilities and will continue to innovate to make the shared ownership experience even better. The Why Through personal experience in both co-owning and seeking access, we learned to appreciate the fantastic advantages of co-owning. At the same time, there were many challenges that could be solved or decreased. We realised that shared ownership will be a strong movement that ultimately will create much more sustainable ownership possible. So we got work, and we'll continue with the aim to make co-owning a top-of-mind way of consuming, all across the globe.",,"11,12,",,,,
2827,Littlebearabroad,http://littlebearabroad.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/littlebearabroad,"The Pitch Littlebearabroad is creating an in real life space for newly arrived parents to use as a home away from home whilst creating a life in Sweden with kids. The What There are approximately 119,000 foreign born families living in Stockholm län and that number is growing with the expansion of international talent requisition. Unfortunately, 42% of foreign assignments end because the family fails to integrate. The key to retaining that talent is successful integration of the family. But, so often is the case that international families who arrive in Sweden, because of work, love or study, fall through the public integration process cracks. This is particularly the case with young international families whose first few years living in Sweden can be isolating, frustrating ending in loss of autonomy which leads to repatriation. Our focus is predominantly with female travelling spouses, they make up approx 60% of travelling spouses. This issue is scalable. As Sweden continues to promote itself as a hub of international business development, the retention and integration of international talent is paramount. The How Firstly, Littlebearabroad offers a barrier free digital platform with information and signposting about cultural, practical and local activities via our website. We're particularly proud of the work we've achieved in real life via our open playgroup and meet ups that act as a starting point for many international families living in Stockholm län. Our long term goal is to create a co-learning space, similar to a start-up co-working space, in which newly arrived families can meet, learn, have fun, and build socially autonomous networks that promote sustainable communities and a stepping stone to long term community integration for international families. The Why It's tough starting out in Sweden, we know because we've done it too. Littlebearabroad started out as a cathartic, scrappy blog in 2015. It was born out of the frustration of being unable to access the information and sign posting we needed to feel like we were successfully integrating, particularly with kids. This led to finding more and more people who felt the same, and the rest is history. We now have a readership of approx 9,000 global a month and approx 3000 social media followers.

By merging small orders into larger orders, businesses can service their customers with fewer transactions. This reduces the cost of operations and help build communities. Our achievements We have now been using our MVP since the end of 2017, testing and verifying how suppliers and their customers interact with the platform. Our goal has been to simplify the service to the max - now, spring 2020, we are getting there. The How We started by working on group orders to make distribution more efficient. Then, we tackled the complexity of organising group orders and worked on the process. We also make it possible for any supplier to benefit from this process of enabling group orders from their devoted customers. More to come! The Why As business owners (distribution of natural and biodynamic food and drinks in Sweden), we wanted to reduce the cost of sales (admin, invoicing, transport). As consumers, we wanted to buy really good food for himself and decided to reduce transport costs by grouping orders with friends and neighbours. COVID-effect Physical distancing has created a need to change our consumption habits - pool.farm can help with this by reducing the number of transactions (fewer contacts) while servicing the customers. What's next? We have a core team of super talented people - highly experienced professionals who love the project. We now want to accelerate development in order to realise our business potential.

It's a community-driven marketplace that offers new ways to consume - without having to buy anything at all! The What Recent years' discussions on sustainability have often focused on consumption. Of course, we need to change our consumption patterns to stop wasting the earth's resources. But an important issue that is easily forgotten is about how we use what we already have. Your forgotten shirt, the jeans in the wrong size, the party outfit that you're tired of, the ice-skates you never have time to skate with - all these things could be used by someone else instead of collecting dust in your home. The sooner we realize that we need to take advantage of what we already have, the better. According to a survey by Myrorna, 89% state that they have clothes at home that do not use, because they are in the wrong size, you have tired of them or we have simply forgot about them. An unused garment is an unused resource, especially as recent research has shown that as much as 70% of a garment's climate impact occurs during production The How Swapster creates the worlds first shared closet and storage. The platform enables a ""virtual"" storage that they share with their friends and people nearby. It is a community where you swap your belongings with each other! Swapster enables barter. It is about changing ""real value"" to another ""real value"". When you swap, you get something back for what you give, the change happens if both see that they get a higher value in each other's real goods. Swapping is a smart way to save money. When you sell a second hand you usually do not get back what you bought the case for new price, but when you change, you have the opportunity to switch to something that has the equivalent value. The Why Ebba (the founder) used to work for H&M and realized that I wanted to make a true difference! The society that we live in now promote shopping and you get the feeling thet you never have enough, I started to question this lifestyle and wanted to promote something mindful, minimalistic and sustainable instead.

2831,Roju,http://www.roju.ai,https://plusimpact.io/startups/roju-1,"The Pitch Roju is an online rental service for quality products with delivery and pickup. The What The consumption of manufactured goods contributes to 17 % of global household greenhouse gas emissions. The sharing economy is on the rise, but stuck with a chicken-and-egg problem due to a p2p marketplace focus: 1) There's not enough supply, as low order value and high effort per transaction don’t incentivize consumers. 2) There's not enough demand, as the low supply volume is spread out over vast geographic areas. There’s just not enough liquidity in most product categories for each geographic area to get the marketplaces rolling. The How To tackle the chicken-and-egg problem, Roju has launched in ‘Single Player Mode’, i.e. owning and controlling supply ourselves: 1) We buy useful and fun items with a high purchase price (>200 €) and low utilization rate (< 4 uses/year). 2) We rent these items on a web service with delivery and pickup for a daily fee (>15€/day). We focus on solving problems with a curated, holistic and high quality service experience (e.g. bundling items, proper instructions). Supply is optimized by measuring potential demand. In the long term, the supply side can be opened to consumers and other companies to create a marketplace for rental items. The Why There are 3 key reasons why we’re pursuing the concept: 1) We want to create an enjoyable workplace. We’re not satisfied in the situation we’re currently in. Culture is key. 2) We want to make a positive impact. We’re all hippies, business hippies to be precise. Sustainability is essential. 3) We want to challenge ourselves. We’re super ambitious, and even working in an emerging industry we’re just wheels in an unstoppable machine. True innovation is our dream.",,"12,13,",,,,

2833,YouViaMe,https://youviame.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/youviame-1,"The Pitch YouViaMe is a matchmaking app where friends help their single friends find long lasting healthy relationships, by matching them together with their other single friends. Every match is a date within 7 days. The What 3. Good Health and Well-Being Such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. Nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. One of our biggest health issues is loneliness and its proven that people are more happy if they are in a relationship or have strong relationships around them. The How Many people want to find someone, but the landscape of finding someone isn't easy, especially as there is not easy to find someone when all the dating apps and services are built with gamification so that you get hooked but not find anyone. YouViaMe is not only the most safest dating app on the market, it's also fully focused on making people meet in real life. Users can't chat in the app, every match, facilitated by a friend that they trust and know, becomes a date within 7 days at our partners venue. The Why I became single and downloaded all the different dating apps on the market and realised rather quickly that none of the apps actually want you to find someone. Let's use Tinder for example, all users have a tinder score and you can only get matched with people within your score, if you swipe yes on to many, then they will only show you everyone who said no etc. I was tired of the way they we're built and just wanted to change it and help people meet. In YouViaMe, when a single user finds someone, they just become matchmaker for their single friends, more ""pay it forward"" thought than just locking people in to the app and not allowing them to find love.",,3,People,,,

Mindfit have the potential to reach people who would otherwise not receive help by removing the barriers to treatment. Mindfit is designed so that it simulates some of the issue and techniques a psychologist wold use in his or her first meeting with an individual seeking help. We make therapeutic techniques more accessible. Mindfit is suitable for all kinds of people in difficult situations or who are in a period of their lives where they feel stressed, worried, anxious, need motivation or are depressed and lack energy. The tool is inspired by well-recognized treatments such as cognitive therapy, positive psychology and EMDR, but also by the more general communication and therapy techniques used in psychology. The How It’s easy to get stuck in negative thoughts and feelings about yourself when you go trough a tough time like stress, lack of energy and motivation or depression. With simple steps and techniques Mindfit teaches users to shift their focus away from negative thought patterns and low self-esteem, to a greater sense of mastery and positive thoughts about themselves. It helps users to be aware of their problem areas, and gain insight into what prevents them from changing their situation, in part by becoming aware of negative thoughts and feelings. Mindfit helps users to set goals, focus on and achieve them. This goal setting process helps the user to refocus the negative energy into a constructive and positive experience raising self-esteem and reinforcing positive thoughts. Change takes time and usually consists of both progress and setbacks. Mindfit helps you see that you are on the right track! The Why We want to help others – shift focus, set limits and get a greater sense of empowerment with respect to the challenges we all face in our everyday lives. Everyone has periods where they feel depressed, worried or anxious as a result of private or work-related challenges. Adversity and setbacks are a normal part of life.",,3,People,,,
2835,New Movements,http://www.newmovements.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/new-movements,"The Pitch New Movements was founded to accelerate the transition to ethical and sustainable fashion for the benefit of the earth and humanity. Hence our company ethos “Walk With Impact.” We are not interested in short-lived trends, but responsibility, sustainability, and function. The What The vast majority of footwear produced in today’s market is overpriced, overproduced, made with synthetic materials and harmful chemicals, resulting in low quality with short durability. Altogether this leads to overconsumption and devastating effects on the environment. 87% of today's footwear manufacturing is in Asia, often under unethical working conditions that include unlivable wages, child labor, health hazards, and general disregard for human life and environment for the sake of profit. The How We are going to raise the bar in the footwear industry with sustainable production of shoes made with premium recycled and natural materials manufactured in an ethical way with a transparent supply chain. We believe full transparency is going to differentiate New Movements in the market, giving customers full insight into the whole supply chain: suppliers, manufacturers, and shipping. Building a fully transparent supply chain is not done overnight, and we are working on making this a reality in collaboration with our partners and with the use of new technology. Today we achieve transparency by having an entirely European supply chain and through handpicking every single supplier and manufacturer to ensure ethical and sustainable origin. The Why New Movements' founder Martin Evensen’s grandfather and great grandfather were cobblers in Norway, where he grew up. When Evensen went to San Francisco to study fashion and merchandise in school from 2011 to 2015, he held onto the craftsmanship and quality that he learned from his family. In continuation of his family legacy, he decided to take a different and more sustainable approach to the footwear business. Martin Evensen's idea for a good-quality, classic sneaker designed for a contemporary consumer who cares about the environment evolved into New Movements. Martin Evensen founded New Movements in Oslo in February 2018. A short time after, he brought his friend and former college, Nils Wiiburg, onboard as a co-founder.",,"8,12,13,",,,,
2836,Social Impact Revolution,https://www.socialimpactrevolution.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/social-impact-revolution,"The Pitch Empowering the future today for a better tomorrow.

Through effective workshops, teaching resources, student-led project-based learning, professional development training, and now gamification, we hope to make learning about sustainability impactful and fun! The How We want to gamify sustainability education and make it interesting to learn about the Global Goals and empower participants to engage in action for a better tomorrow. Right now, we are working on producing a board game, but we want to do it in a sustainable manner. Perhaps +impact can help connect our supply chain with companies with similar values. The Why I am a teacher and saw this gap between the initiatives of Agenda 2030 and the future generations. Social Impact Revolution is my startup and an attempt at bridging the gap. We now have a product that municipalities and schools are interested in testing and buying and could really use support to continue this endeavor.",,"4,12,",,,,
2837,MillenniumHus,http://www.millenniumhus.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/millenniumhus,"The Pitch We are not competing on the market, we are making new standards. MillenniumHus is a knowledge company that has developed and patentet valuable methods and products to be used to construct houses of all sizes. -Astonishing savings of CO2 emissions. -Industrialisation -Lower building costs The What The housing construction market is one of the largest contributors to pollution in the world emitting huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and has a rather poor utilization of natural resources. In addition to the pollution of constructing a house, of any size, the energy needed to control the climate within the construction (heating/cooling) is very high and a large contributor to CO2 emissions, specially in colder climates in higher developed countries. Of all methods of constructing a heated building, in colder climates, wooden houses are the ones that leave at least CO2 footprints. The disadvantage of the wooden houses in these demanding conditions is low life expectancy due to the breakdown of the construction which is of biological materials and cannot withstand very long the constant moisture and heat differences. Failures in constructions are also very widespread and a growing problem in a world where lower demand for expertise is growing to gain more profits. The How The basic solution is very simple. We have built from there and ended up with very advanced and user friendly products. We took the structural parts of the construction into the inside environment. By doing that the constructions most essential parts will never be exposed to the weather elements and seasonal changes. There will be no reason for the main construction to deteriorate since the climate it is standing in is controlled. In addition to that we have been able, due to the structural design, to eliminate all thermal bridges. Thermal bridges have a huge role in lower energy efficiency and lead to deterioration of structures made from wood by ""creating"" suitable conditions for insects and microorganisms to thrive in and populate. The method uses up to 48% less wood and 20% less isolation to gain the same results as known methods. The Why Ambition to reach perfection. The method is not an idea that came like lighting a bulb one day and was taken from there. It is a development that started more then 25 years ago. That is the time that the innovator of the method has used to gain experience and perfection in his work that has been within new constructions and maintenance of constructions, contiunuusly for over 25 years. The correct mind set, with the correct experience gained, in the right conditions and changes of demands of the marked with the combined focus on environment and solutions to pollution problems all came together, at the right time and the tight places and ended up with the method and products that MillenniumHus stands for.",,"9,12,13,",,,,
2838,Comeat,http://www.comeat.net,https://plusimpact.io/startups/comeat-1,"The Pitch Comeat is a new concept within experience and sharing economy, for people passionate about travel, food and making friends from around the world. Our users open their homes and offer others to share dinner, fulfilling a market need for fun experiences and relations between visitors and locals. The What Many who are new to a city don’t have a wide network outside their work/studies, and often eat dinner alone. Cooking a nice meal for one might be expensive and time consuming, so in many cases people end up buying take-away, as it is more convenient and cheaper, potentially resulting in loneliness and unhealthy diets. As more travelers visit the cities, more restaurants need to open and local shops close. This has led to a negative feel among locals, and a “them vs. us” mentality. In addition, there is a Western World trend towards nationalistic feelings and xenophobia, that contributes to a more divided world, enhancing the issue. For some people, it is challenging to embrace other cultures and they often fear what they don’t know. Another negative point for society, is that when you buy products from supermarkets, they often come in bundled packages. When people eat alone, this results in high cost and a lot of food being wasted, as it goes bad before it can be used. The How We want to open up the young generation's mindset, towards people from other cultures. With Comeat we believe we can influence people by exposing them to the differences between cultures in a positive setting and create friendships across nationalities and borders. The Comeat community gives our users fun and authentic experiences, exotic healthy food options and potential new international friends. By pushing the locals-travellers shared dinners, we can break down the nationalistic mentality, take some of the traffic away from restaurants, and help reduce food waste and loneliness of hosts, making it both a sustainable and social initiative. The Why We are a team of 8 young and motivated members, all from different countries, and all current or previous expats. We have a shared passion for travel, food and meeting new people, and this is what Comeat is all about. We have an ambition to work on creating a change in the world, and not just to get paid.",,"3,11,12,",,,,

We create open-innovation based technology and services that can change our world for the better. But we cannot do it on our own. Only us together can solve this mess. It’s just us! The What We are developing an independent system for monitoring and verifying the performance of smaller solar power installations owned by private customers or smaller enterprises. Today a solar power system is a rather big investment for most private customers or small companies, and many times they do not know if they are getting what they have payed for. They might be loosing out on performance that they should have been guaranteed by the manufacturer, and this might affect their payback time and also turn out to be a significant reduction in life-span of the system. Installers and vendors of solar power systems also suffer from bad quality of solar power modules. With our system they have a way of monitoring what they have installed and doing predictive maintenance, as well as making sure that they are not endorsing bad products. Last but not least, we also offer tailored data from real world systems back to the manufacturers, for them to use in their research and development. The How We are using an open-innovation and open-source approach, and through this we can make sure that we deliver our system at almost zero marginal cost, and thus making the system very cost-effective without letting down on quality and performance. The open-innovation approach also makes us more versatile than the competition, since we can more quickly adapt to new technologies and adapt new ideas into our products. Also, the open-innovation approach enables smart and passionate people from all around the globe to contribute to our products and make them even better. Our system consists of a hardware that is a logging unit together with a sensoring unit for each string of solar power modules, together with a cloud service and an app that enables our customers to monitor and verify the performance and any issues with their solar power systems. The Why Our story is like most stories worth telling, nothing but a straight line. The company has it's origins in a master thesis project in Engineering Physics that was performed by one of the founders (Fredrik Trella) in collaboration between Uppsala University in Sweden and the University of Nairobi in Kenya. During a previous summer internship at a wave energy company called Wavetube Fredrik met with Sara West, an ambitous entrepreneur and leader with a passion for renewable energies and innovative technology. And when the two met over a beer to discuss life in the autumn of 2017 it turned out that both of them were ready for new challenges and adventures in the startup realm. So they decided to make something real out of Fredrik's old ideas from the Master Thesis, and thus Justus Technologies was founded. Also, as with most good stories, 1000 characters are not nearly enough to tell it. So to read the full story of our origins, please check out our website!",,"7,11,",,,,
2840,mfore,http://www.mfore.fi,https://plusimpact.io/startups/mfore-1,"The Pitch engaging patient for better health outcome in thier treatment pathway The What Healthcare providers are faced with the challenge of low care plan adherence by patients, inefficient administration, poor population reach and low patient retention rates. Moreover, it is considered that healthcare provider takes responsibility of the patients’ treatment, which is quite challenging because of the ever-growing gap between doctor-patient ratio. Disconnect between healthcare provider and patient’s in-between encounters during patient pathway causing poor care outcome and wasted care. Our offering helps providers to be in continuous dialog with patients even beyond the care setting to improve care outcome, reduce care cost, enhance care experience and strengthen patient relationship. The How mfore provides the technology platform and service for healthcare providers, to utilize mobile communication channels to have a continuous dialogue with patients and care givers (e.g. family members) outside the care setting and between encounters. Our offering enables healthcare providers to converse with patients and care givers with relevant information at right times to educate, remind and reinforce the prescribed care and get insights to patient’s progress in the care process. mfore’s Patient Engagement Service (PES) provides simple to use mobile communication services to enable monitoring, adherence, counselling for healthcare providers and their patients. Patient Engagement Solution - “Simple and Functional” whether you are a patient, a doctor or a surgeon. Our solutions are simple to use but incredibly functional. Making excellent patient engagement accessible, available and affordable by design. The Why Personal and family experience of disconnect with healthcare provider during the treatment when not at healthcare location. The need for engaging patient is even more, considering the ever increasing patient numbers and needs as well lower healthcare literacy rate among general population. Especially when most of the time patients are looking for the answers to following questions when they are outside of hospital settings: • What is my main problem? • What do I need to do? • Why is it important for me to do this? Hence the role of Doctors and healthcare professionals becomes more challenging, as they need to educate the patient as well. But then the shortage of time on healthcare professionals, a patient does not get satisfying or meaningful answers. That leads to poor or low treatment adherence. This is where the solution like ours come as conduit between patients and doctors that enables the continuous communication (two-way), resulting in better healthcare outcomes.",,3,People,,,

The information we are looking for is rarely the same, which means that it will often not be present when we decide what to buy. But with Eachthing you can request the information you are missing and others can rally behind it. That way you can help drive transparency and develop the next generation of sustainable products. The How With AI we build tools to understand consumer behaviour, pains and demands.

2843,Compax Solutions,https://www.compax.no,https://plusimpact.io/startups/compax-solutions-1,"The Pitch As much as 20-40 per cent of the waste volume generated from these buildings origins from paper towels from dispensers in restrooms. Some building challenges this causes: (1) high logistics cost due to frequent waste disposal (2) high consumption of plastic bags (3) waste overflow between cleaning The What We want to reduce wasted resources, both in terms of time, plastic bags, and money. With our solution, building operators will work more efficiently, change plastic bags in waste bins less often, and thus reducing the total cost of the operations. This benefits everything from large office buildings and university campuses, to gas stations. The How Despite the above-mentioned challenges, paper towels are the preferred option among users due to the speed of drying consumers’ hands, proper drying and consumer satisfaction. The paper towel industry is anticipated to have an annual average growth rate of 4,08% in the forecast period (2018-2021). Thus, high waste volumes from paper towels and its demanding repercussions, e.g., logistical challenges is a growing problem globally. As a result, there is a need for new innovative solutions to secure efficient and sustainable waste management in buildings to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Our technology allows for a small, light, and efficient systems which can be mounted on the wall, but at the same time retain the same compression ratio, compared to more complicated products. The Why By observing waste handling in large public and corporate buildings, we had discovered inefficiency in these processes on multiple levels.

The What Access to quality and affordable education The How WeMotion exits to end the cycle of poverty for girls in Africa through online mentoring and education using technology. This is important because we believe that every girl no matter where they are born or raised deserved the chance to get a quality and affordable education. Many girls in the Gambia where we work drop out of school due to child marriage, teenage pregnancies or harmful traditional practices. We believe that mentoring will help transforms the lives of girls in the Gambia through the guidance of mentors. The change is important in order to reduce the global inequality for girls in Africa. And the key to that is education leading to at-risk girls impacting their communities and the world at large. A possible solution to the current challenges. We started based on my lived experiences, as a founder of seeing forced and early marriages, teenage pregnancies, and female genital cutting as a core problem forcing girls to drop out of school. I knew it wasn't right, and I never wish it for any girl child. My solution to change the system is creating awareness about the importance of girl’s education.

Our business model needs to be focused for the purposes of commercial viability and scaling. But we strongly believe that keeping our focus also on large societal challenges enables us to reach real life measurable impact in people's lives. We do currently measurement of social relations and tensions between different ethnic groups, namely Finns and refugees. We believe that humans need to be prepared for even not-far-from-apocalyptic scenarios (climate refugees, warfare) in the next decades, where the ability to live peacefully becomes the priority number one for all mankind. We need initiatives globally, regionally and locally to sustain peace, to prevent and resolve conflicts. That's why we work with the UN and Inforglobe's CEO Mikaeli lectures at the UN System Staff College on subject matter ICT for Peace. It will be a crucial factor how technologies are harnessed for the good, and not the bad. It requires visionary thinking, but also very practical work with people, on the ground, in the mud. We would love to be part of your ecosystem and work together towards a more humane and technology savy world.

The approach is to work with educational experts globally and connect tested and validated learning games to their platform. Localization of this content is done with local partners, to make sure content is locally relevant for children. The platform is then packaged into an app, through which children can learn and practice literacy and math. The What That every child finish primary school. The How Checheza started as a small project in 2015 by 4 of the current team members. We wanted to understand why many children drop out of school, and see if we could find a solution using technology. We realized there exists plenty of high quality digital educational content around the world, but it was neither accessible nor relevant for the children who needed it the most. This has become our mission: to build a platform where great content can be localized and delivered on the devices and through the channels that are accessible to children in the risk of dropping out of school or finishing school without essential skills. In september 2018, after understanding the problem and our users, and building our first game, we felt ready to register our company Checheza AB in Sweden, and in November 2018 we launched our Beta in Uganda.

Vi er ved at udvikle en podcast målrettede lærere og pædagoger, et tre dags trivselsforløb for børn og unge på skoler samt en digital læringsplatform til forældre, som skal bestå af moduller, der skal klæde forældre på til at opdrage deres børn digitalt. The What Digital opdragelse The How Den digitale virkelighed er allestedsnærværende. Uanset, om det drejer sig om underholdning, information eller socialt samvær, er det digitale blevet en kendsgerning. Som forælder, lærer eller pædagog stiller det nye krav til vores samvær med børnene. Hvornår er noget sund og givende brug, og hvornår er noget skadeligt og destruktivt? Hvor og hvordan skal grænserne sættes, og i hvilken grad skal vi være deltagende. Det vrimler med skrækindjagende nyhedsoverskrifter og vandrehistorier. Som voksne tilskuere kan det være svært at finde hoved og hale i hvad der er fakta og, hvad der er fiktion. Vores vigtigste formål med Projekt Digital Barndom er, at vi på skoler og i særlig grad i hjemmet skaber en sund og positiv digital kultur. Det kræver, at både elever, fagfolk og forældre bliver klædt på med konkrete værktøjer, som giver størst mulig chance for, at børn og unge kan trives online. Vi har gode erfaringer med at afvikle helhedsorienteret trivselsforløb i skoler og ungdomsuddannelser, men der hvor vi møder de største udfordringer er i hjemmet. Derfor har vi gået sammen med en IT-virksomhed, som kan designe en digital læringsform, som er målrettet forældre. Vores idé er, at modulopdele læringsplatformen i temaer, såsom dialog og grænser, sikkerhed, rettigheder, sociale medier mv. hvor forældre selv kan købe adgang til den eller hvor skoler abonnerer på platformen, som giver adgang til at forældre og evt. fagfolk kan bruge den.

We stand for eating tasty, healthy & environmentally friendly food. Our mission is to cut down soy importation from outside the EU for a more sustainable world and increase the use of locally grown lupin products. We are developing dairy/meat substitutes from locally grown lupin beans, which are rich in plant protein and fiber. Our goal is to stimulate local lupin industries by increasing demand for lupin-based products. The What Cutting down soy importation in the EU The How Europe has become heavily dependent on soya bean imports, entailing trade agreements and quality standards that do not satisfy the European citizen’s expectations. White, yellow, and narrow-leafed lupins are native European legumes that can become true alternatives to soya bean, given their elevated and high-quality protein content, potential health benefits, suitability for sustainable production, and acceptability to consumers. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers. Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address different aspects of the food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. The Why Our mission is to cut down soy importation from outside the EU for a more sustainable world and replace it with locally farmed lupin.",,"3,12,13,",,,,

We strive for our operations to reduce negative impact and to be climate positive, as well as contributing to better self-esteem in teenagers as a social cause. The What Breaking the destructive alcohol norm The How We are a small microbrewery in the southern parts of Stockholm that makes great kombucha for LOHAS (Lifestyles Of Health And Sustainability). It's a family-run business, the seeds of which were sown at a street fair in 2015 where instead of cleaning out the closet to sell old stuff we decided to make and sell kombucha. People bought it and liked it, it sould out. In 2016 we initiated a lean startup and went out and got paying customers right from the start.

We want more patients to get access to good communication and our product is under constant development. November 2018 we are releasing a new and enhanced version. It will then be possible to upgrade to a premium version, for which we will take a small monthly fee. It is possible for anyone to download the app and use the free or premium version, however, at the same time we are approaching clinics and hospitals for larger group deals and procurement. We have also started a collaboration with e.g. Huddinge Emergency Clinic and will perform clinical testing of our application there shortly. Read more on our website! https://caretotranslate.com The Why Care to Translate was first founded as a non-profit organisation due to first-hand experience of communication difficulties in healthcare. Seeing patients not beeing able to get the right care because of their mother tongue made it obvious that a simple tool for translating medical phrases in a correct and safe way was much needed.",,"3,10,",,,,

The workers are hired on normal contracts with ordinary salary. Our sales team visits 100-200 households every week to tell them about our simple recycling service with monthly pickup of glass, metal, bottles, electronic waste and old clothes. Everything is brought to recycling by workers who quit drugs and want to work instead. The What Employment for people who quit drugs The How Medarbeiderne is a small company employing only people with a former history of drugs or alcohol. The workers are hired on normal contracts with ordinary salary. We believe that trusting people builds loyalty and that the positive effect of actually giving people a contract so they can perform as workers and generate value is better than receiving government compensation for work training. We believe many people that are able to sustain a job position are in work training for way to long time. In Norway, most municipalities only pick up certain types of waste from households. Therefore, certain types of waste are not being effectively recycled. We offer a subscription to private households and companies for picking up and removing small electrical waste materials, glass containers and metal packaging on a regular basis. A sales team visits 100-200 households every week to tell them about our simple recycling service with monthly pickup of glass, metal, bottles, electronic waste and old clothes. The subscribers than receive an SMS the day before pickup and put the waste on their doorstep. Everything is brought to recycling by workers who quit drugs and want to work instead. According to Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI), Norway has about 7 000–10 000 intravenous drug users. The figure remains stable. Each year hundreds of people take the difficult leap from drug abuse to sobriety, and many of them want to establish a normal life. Having a job is an important part of this goal. But, these people often face a system that does not give them any real chance to re-establish themselves in society. By trusting people with a history of drug abuse and giving them responsibility they grow confidence and experience the benefit of loyal and talented employees who want to help the company succeed. In addition to the recycling service we are building a relocation service. The Why We want to show the world how former drug addicts can become loyal and responsible workforce trough framework, community and responsability.",,"1,8,10,",,,,

The What off2off works with waste prevention of functional surplus that is to good to be thrown away in organizations and therefore has a very low usagelevel during its lifespan.

In Värmland we were then 3 months away from getting the responsibility for these Pain stimulators in our region. The surplus was because of a change of a regional political decision (worth 140K€) and i saw an insane process and also an opertunity in connecting human technincal aid departments for doing business with each other.

Further, Lifeshelter can be produced locally, thus creating local jobs and capacity building. The What Sustainable and dignified homes for refugees The How When Jakob Christensen was about to carry out his final project on the school of engineering and architecture in Aarhus, Denmark, he ventured on a journey that should prove to change his and many other people’s lives. In collaboration with his grandfather, Jakob developed a shelter that would be able to provide a safe, dignified home for people living in refugee camps. He called it Lifeshelter. The shelter was constructed with inspiration from vault arches of ancient buildings in Nubia, Northeastern Africa, and through five years, Lifeshelter was tested and improved in collaboration with Danish Refugee Council, DanChurchAid, DTU and University of Copenhagen. The durability, resilience and safety, which the shelter offers at a price almost as low as unsustainable, unsafe and unhealthy tents, make the shelter unique. Jakob’s and his team’s mission is now to build as many shelters and schools as possible for vulnerable communities in exposed areas. “We know that there’s a strong association between dignity and physical and mental health. A dignified shelter enables a dignified life”, Jakob says. We sell shelters to NGOs, organizations, and public institutions responsible for rehousing of refugees in camps and settlements. Shelters are being produced locally with natural materials. In our effort to advance the Sustainable Development Goals, we support the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. In our value chain, we strive to combine bottom line profits, sustainable environment practices, and positive societal impact.

We apply the renowned Finnish National Curriculum integrated with best pedagogical practices from around the world to create a personalized, multi-age, skills-driven and strength-based system that is supportively led by teachers as mentors. The What Transform current systems of education The How The societal issue that we are tackling is the outdated teaching and learning methods that stifle creativity, prepare students to standardized tests and in worst case lead to total loss of learning motivation. We started with the simple aim of establishing a new international school in Finland capital region. Then we discovered something bigger: Current educational systems around the world are based on the principles of mass production – they are standardized, prescribed and teacher-controlled, and students are separated by age. Current education, according to research, stifles creativity by expecting students to conform. In a rapidly changing world, people need innovative thinking and creativity to be able to shape their future. Thus, we need a new approach to education - one that prepares students for an unknown future. Yet, to date there are only scattered attempts to provide one. This can only be done in environments that allow students to learn at their own pace, work together and create and follow their interest and strengths. We decided not only to start a school, but make a global educational concept, one that can be exported to any part of the world. We are building a licensable concept, the world's first fully integrated interdisciplinary system, the Nordic Baccalaureate.

Presently, we sell our products in more than 250 stores and fitness centres in DK,DE and UK. The What A sustainable and responsible food culture The How In the next 35 years, the global demand for food will increase 70%, according to the UN. The food industry is already having a significant impact on global warming and our consumption of meat is particularly troublesome for the climate. There is a need for attractive and tasty alternatives to meat that can provide high quality protein as well as other essential nutrients, while having a dramatically smaller CO2-footprint. Insects are a part of the solution, as they have an exceptional nutritional profile that can be compared to getting all the benefits from eating meat, fish and rye bread at once. Also, insects reproduce quickly, they can be farmed vertically, they require less land, 12 times less feed and 2000 times less water compared to producing beef; the equivalent of emitting 100 times less CO2. The solution The most important factor for creating this solution, however, is one of culture and habits. Wholi changes people’s understanding of insects by creating wholesome and delicious foods presented in the most appetizing, so that people cannot resist trying. We started this company based on a vision for change and an urge to create a solution that can help solve issues related to climate change and malnutrition. The two founders have complimentary backgrounds from agricultural development (specialized in edible insects) and business development. We are passionate about building a sustainable company that can take advantage of the growing need for innovative alternatives in order to create impact and financial growth. We are inspired by the rich cultures around the world that for centuries have embraced eating insects, and support smallholder cricket farmers in Cambodia through knowledge sharing.

2885,Aguardio ApS,http://www.aguardio.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/aguardio-aps-1,"The Pitch Aguardio is a simple data-driven IoT solution which helps people live more sustainable by changing their shower behaviour. The What In recent years high level of CO2 emissions, leading to climate change and water shortage, has become worldwide challenges. Water shortage is caused both by draught due to increasingly volatile weather conditions, increasing urbanization and wealth leading to higher demand for water. In Cape Town during Spring 2018, the city was close to running dry – only by appealing heavily to the inhabitants and due to rain Cape Town managed to postpone the water crises. Also, due to the lack of water in summer 2018, UK officials urged the citizens to shower no longer than 4 minutes. These examples emphasize the importance to act. Desalting of seawater is one of the actions carried out to try and solve the issue of water shortage. However, this process is both costly as well as energy intensive, leading to potential higher CO2 emissions. Also, water cleaning is a solution but still being experimental technology and not yet proven to be full scale functional. The How Aguardio is a physical device designed to guide people in a more sustainable direction. Installed in the bathroom, Aguardio facilitates changes in shower behaviour with the aim to reduce water and energy consumption. Aguardio consists of two devices: a sensor placed at the ceiling in the shower cabinet, and a display placed on the wall in the shower cabinet. The sensor collects data on shower behaviour via different individual sensors, e.g movement, acoustic, humidity, temperature etc which are uploaded to a cloud for further analysis. As soon as a shower starts, the wall-mounted display is activated, illustrating shower time. This means, that the display timer stops if water is turned off e.g. while shampooing, and the total bath length is shown when the user leaves the shower cabinet. Pilot test shows that Aguardio can reduce the shower time by 20 percent per shower. The Why Climate change and water shortage have become worldwide challenges, which needs to be addressed. Research shows, that in order to address water shortage efficiently change in human behaviour is needed. We have therefore established Aguardio ApS with a simple mission: to reduce water & energy consumption by supporting, improving and developing sustainable human behave. Aguardio is unique compared to other water saving products on the market, because it provides the user with a direct and instant nudging effect while showering and at the same time collects data concerning the shower behaviour via Aguardio Sensor. The collected data creates a foundation for water and energy savings goals which makes Aguardio a solution adapted to individual needs, whereas other products are universal solution without the possibility of user influence.",,"6,12,13,",,,,

The most popular of our intentions is to conduct the delivery from a produce supplier to their clients (shops or restaurants), where the robot can travel the shortest direct route. Our second most popular is the option to carry out on-demand deliveries to the recipients at their own convenience rather than a wide timeframe during working hours, reducing the number of rescheduling and missed deliveries. Robots are not limited to only being able to operate during the day, allowing them to be able to carry out the service after hours. The Why Our ambition is to provide the future with a clean and efficient delivery service, where seeing robots in public will be normal. To be able to claim that we contributed to this exciting future brings us joy, and to know the positive effects it will bring to society in cost, convenience, and environmental factors.",,"9,11,",,,,

We humans have an impact as well by polluting water reservoirs or in excess use of water beds. Global resupply of fresh water is broken as rain falls are getting intencive, fall in 'wrong' place or simple no rain. Providing drinking water is not enough as we use only 10% for domestic use. 20% of fresh water is used in manufacturing etc. lead by food business and followed closely by forestry. 95% of world trade is depending in fresh water supply. BUT 70% goes to irrigation, which means that if we run out irrigation water we will starve. We must start to use fresh water in multistage ways before it gets salty again as desalination is the most expensive method (we do not better yet) to desalinate the water as well using a lot of energy. As long we can recirculate the water as fresh we are saving energy and water and it will enable us to use waste (used?) water as raw material source.

The What Clothing consumption – let’s rethink and react The How Nature is asking that we (need to) change our consumerism. BEVAR is looking specifically into our habits about clothes. Consumption of clothes has increased rapidly in Western societies, resulting in a massive textile material stream which creates environmental problems. The textile industry is the second worst industry when it comes to causing environmental problems, only preceded by the oil and gas production. These problems are in large part due to the habits of the consumer. A piece of clothing is only used for at the very short time and is usually thrown out way before the actual end of its lifetime. BEVAR has been working for at a couple of years trying to expand the time of use. We have been concentrating on the challenge concerning the waste of jeans. They are causing tremendous problems because of an extreme use of water, chemicals and transportation in producing them. Out of wasted jeans, BEVAR has been creating new products.

We both graduated from university to become art researchers, but the thrive to work for something that has more immediate effect on our environment and culture pushed us to create our own sustainable fashion brand. Our mission was always to create carefully designed products that live up to our own expectations. During the first years we gathered a lot of information about how textiles are recycled within textile rental companies, why are the textiles discarded in the first place and what kind of qualities these textiles have. In 2013 we released the first collection based on the reuse of rental textiles. The company, TAUKOdesign oy was established in 2014. Today we present two full womenswear collections annually. They reflect our passion for contemporary art and design and respect for sustainable values. Our unique TAUKO recycling concept is based on local, discarded rental textiles as the raw materials of the production. Working closely together with local producers and research groups, we constantly develop new methods to prepare recycled materials for our collections. These materials are mostly textiles that have been used in Finnish and German restaurants and hotels. In addition to discarded textiles, we also utilize surplus knits and yarns, and organic wool for our collections. We show our respect to the skilful people working for our production and visit them regularly in Finland and Estonia. TAUKO stands for a break or a pause in Finnish.

With Normative, you no longer need to be a sustainability expert to engage in sustainability accounting.

The number of companies who engage in sustainability accounting has grown exponentially over the past 15 years, from only a handful to several thousands. However, over 90% of companies use old spreadsheet technology for sustainability accounting. Subsequently, the whole sustainability accounting process takes several months and usually costs between $100,000-$200,000, which makes it inaccessible to SMEs.

At the same time, we want to bring better coffee experiences into the everyday life. 1) by creating great taste experiences, and 2) by connecting the farmers' craftsmanship to the customers. The What Coffee that tastes good and does good The How ØNSK is a passionate coffee company that imports premium coffee beans from the volcanic highlands of Nicaragua. From here they are sent directly to Denmark, where the coffee is roasted, packed and sent out to you, your workplace, cafes or your local specialty store. We have cut all expensive intermediaries as much as possible, so as much as possible is landing in the manufacturer's own pocket. The idea originated from our travels in Central America and Africa, where we were both provoked to see how the consumer goods we import in the Western world do not cater for the wear and tear of the peasants in the production. At the same time, we are both deeply fascinated by the coffee's slow manufacturing process, from the coffee plant on the ground to the freshly brewed coffee in the cup. ØNSK therefore not only offers coffee that tastes good, but it also does good! We carefully select our business partners and it is a strong foundation in wishing our work in Nicaragua to support sustainable development for the individual producer and the entire community. Therefore, we emphasize that our producers protect nature and actively work to maintain local biodiversity. Therefore, we support projects that educate coffee farmers to streamline and develop their production so that they can exist side by side with the natural animal and plant life. It is one of ØNSK's absolutely strong core values to deliver a great coffee that can be enjoyed with a good conscience. Coffee binds some of the poorest and richest people in the world together! We are therefore humble and very proud to serve a world-class coffee. For us, coffee is much more than what is in the cup. It is an everyday luxury and a taste experience that extends far into the Central American jungle. Today ØNSK is delivering coffee experiences to 70 offices around Denmark as well as a handfull cafés and specialty shops.

From our perspective, the future of materials means programming them from the start to last only as long as we need them. That means when you want to buy a new pair of shoes, just toss your old Apple Leather ones! The What We turn apples into leather. The How Our philosophy is designing with sustainability from the start. Once a pair of Apple Leather shoes hits soil, they disappear within 6 months. This is how we define sustainability. It’s not necessary for our shoes to last +140 years (United Nations). Now you can consume guilt-free. Life doesn’t use forceful chemistry to thrive, but smart chemistry that’s safe.

Among our competitors are: MycoWorks leather grown from mushrooms, Pinatex leather from pineapple leaves or Frumat apple-based “glue” applied to the surface of a prefabricated textile. Our first customers are mid-large size companies seeing sustainability as a key to success. We’re forming relationships with Stella Mccartney and Edun Amerikas among others.

This sense of purpose me and my team have, for this opportunity to really solve the leather problem is what gets us up in the morning. We are the team to make the first 100% biodegradable leather made from food waste. Hannah got the idea over 2 years ago in her fashion studies, looking to waste for design inspiration. In the next 6 months we’ll focus on improving durability and maintaining biodegradability. This means achieving EU minimum requirements in water resistance and physical/ mechanical property performance. We’ll achieve strength comparable to animal leather end 2018 and long-lasting characteristics over time by March 2019. Industry minimum requirements will be met mid 2019.

The What In Plant Jammer we believe that meat consumption and food waste are one of the biggest environmental challenges of our age. If all of us skipped meat one day a week it would make a tramendous impact. It is a small change, but we need to do it on a civilizational scale, which makes it a difficult task. Laws and regulations are not a fit solution. We need to change the way we cook and the way we shop. Everyone uses recipes for centuries to learn how to cook new meals. It is however difficult to find recipes that match your needs and especially hard to find recipes that only use ingredients you have at home. The How Plant Jammer leveraged machine and human intelligence alike to discover patterns in recipes. We uncovered modules that make up a well balanced dish and we trained a machine learning model to predict the best maches to your ingredients. We can use this in a simple journey where you create a recipe yourself in a step by step fashion. The recipes you create fit your needs perfectly and only use the ingredients you have. If you don't know what exactly you want, you can just choose a health target and we do the heavy lifting for you. Plant Jammer gives you freedom in your own kitchen. The freedom to choose any diet you want and a confidence to stick to it. We believe people will make the right choice themselves. The Why Michael Haase, our CEO worked closely with the food chain during his time in London. He saw how it didn't work and got inspired by the farm to table movement. The final push was finding out how great is the impact of animal production on global warming. His energy is very contagious and I joined Michael shortly after he founded the company. I share his vision, but I'm also very excited about using machine intelligence in gastronomy. This is Michael's LinkedIn by the way.

The What Creating a platform for sustanable consumption The How Better World Fashion is an award-winning sustainable pioneer and we have been rewarded for our ground-breaking, disruptive journey. The renowned Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation, the world's leading expert on the circular economy, has published a case study about Better World Fashion. We are B-Corp certified and the first Danish company ever, that received the 'Best for the Environment' certificate in 2017 and 2018. Our jackets are 98% re-use, 100% unique, Danish Design, made in Europe. The objective of BWF is to promote and inspire sustainable alternatives to the traditional business models within the textile industry. The business model is based on a circular philosophy, which accommodates the current consumption patterns in a more sustainable way. The circular business model of BWF revolves around following concepts. Reworked leather: BWF uses only sustainable materials in their jackets such as recycled lining and recycled leather. As opposed to traditional recycling, BWF reworks recycled leather by collecting, disassembling and redesigning it into new leather jackets from different pieces of recycled leather. This secures better resource exploitation, as the leather is kept in circulation thereby prolonging its lifespan. The circular philosophy is particularly suitable in relation to leather, as high quality leather is highly durable and thus possesses the ability to be recycled and reworked into new pieces of clothing. Storytelling: Since each jacket is constructed from different pieces of reworked skin, each jacket is unique and has its own story, which is communicated to the consumer. As such each jacket can be traced back to their previous owners. BWF intends to write pedigrees for each jacket, which will be updated continuously and communicated to the consumer each time a jacket is delivered to the consumer. Leasing and buy back: A central part of the business model is the consumer can rent a jacket or buy with a unlimited buyback guarantee. The Why The world is in need of something new.Not new things.

2907,GoSol,http://www.gosol.solar,https://plusimpact.io/startups/gosol,"The Pitch GoSol.solar's SOL5 is a cost-effective technology for concentrating sunlight for thermal needs. Our aim is to break the cost-barriers currently limiting deployment of solar thermal technologies in both industrial and local entrepreneurial applications. We are on a mission to make people’s lives richer, breathe easier and make the environment cleaner through our GoSol scalable solar tech. We support the transition towards a massive use of clean energy for all. The What Mitigate climate change impact for SMEs The How It all started as a great adventure to participate to climate change mitigation and solve energy poverty (lack of clean energy access among farmers and SME's in developing countries). If we could increase the wealth of local entrepreneurs, this would create more local stability, more clean energy and food security, and less deforestation of course. Solar panels can provide electricity but have limiting factors: they are mostly made in China with huge impact on climate during fabrication and shipping, and they cannot provide high temperature heat needed to power activities (in many sectors most of the energy need is heat). So, we started to work on Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) solutions for SME's. One of our 1st prototype was used by a Mexican cooperative to roast chocolate. After that 1st success, our team was keen to solve more technical challenges, one of them being to be able to build in any country with local material. So we continued the R&D process in Mali, Haiti, Mexico, France, Cuba, India, Switzerland, Finland, Canada. Then we decided to structure things and to start a start-up and we choose Finland because of the very healthy business practices and innovative start-up landascape. Operations started in 2015 when we did consultancies to solve thermal engineering issues with our innovative software. Then we also partnered with the NGO World Vision. With them, we piloted our first SOL5 solar concentrators in Kenya with bakers and organic peanut butter producers. They adopted SOL5 immediately and are still using it. SOL5 improves the quality of their products, it also saves money on electricity and charcoal bill. A 2d wave of successful pilots was made possible last year with financing from Autodesk Foundation and from Wärtsilä. The ROI is now less of 18 months. Currently, our clients are big NGOs such as Plan International, who are buying our educational package to train young entrepreneurs. We started our A-round to start the production line.

2908,Useless Company,https://useless.fi/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/useless-company-1,"The Pitch Useless Company wants to stop over consumption and accelerate the amount of investments made to sustainability. The first product of Useless Company is Useless application. The app links active and the new ways of saving money to impact investing, creating a double impact for the sustainability: saving alone benefits the environment, as one euro saved equals to approximately 500 grams of CO2 reduction, and if the saved money is invested in a sustainability, the effect can be doubled. The What Accelerate investments to climate The How Useless Company creates an application for active saving and impact investing. It targets environmentally aware people, who are willing to do more for the environment. Useless Company’s core service, Useless app, helps individuals reconsider their unnecessary consumption (“use less”), and allows them to save money in an easy, fun and interesting way, and to invest in sustainable investments . The change in consumption habits are important as approximately 70 % of greenhouse gas emissions result from consumption decisions of individuals. Also investments to sustainability for example to mitigate climate change needs to be accelerated. Useless is an university spinoff-company. It is mostly premised on research conducted in 2017. Data of Statistics Finland was examined in order to find out, how does an average household consume in Finland, and is there a possible potential of decreasing the unnecessary consumption. According to results average Finnish household can decrease annual consumption by 10 % (over 3000e) with small behavioral changes. We have huge potential, but how to harness it? The idea was developed further to get some actual change happening. All the team members are experts on sustainability with research background and trying to get more impact and change felt meaningful and Useless Company was founded. Useless app will be a platform, which contains verified instruments or projects of company’s partners, in which users may invest in or donate to. Currently we have a demo of Useless app which we are now testing and developing further. We are also currently negotiating the core partnerships and looking for funding and growing our team.

We focus on giving a rewarding experience to the donors that include showing them their ongoing environmental impact by their donations and making it a fun, positive, and empowering to give to green projects. We aim to support social enterprises around the world with solid environmental impact measurements. The What Empower people to support green projects The How We provide a digital crowdfunding platform for the purpose to connect every day people who want to contribute to climate change solutions with their donations whether in small or larger amounts. We aim to provide a fun and rewarding experience for them in contrast to the climate change topic itself which seems to have a gloomy effect on the population such as, fly less, eat less meat, and etc. We aim to provide multiple positive solutions to the donors to select from at anytime. The platform will display the environmental impact each donor has, by aggregating the impact of their donations across all projects a donor can donate to via Oaseit. We found this change in the attitude and to empower everyday people important because this is a shift in the attitude people have on climate change. We hope that people will see the innovative and trying solutions out in the market that are aiming to solve for climate change issues instead of a negative and helpless attitude in that maybe they should fly on airplanes less or that they don´t have enough money or power to make a positive change. Oaseit when CEO/co-founder, herself when she was feeling the exact way about feeling guilty as a normal citizen on her negative effects on the climate, and she looked for actions to take and place to donate to. Unfortunately, she couldn´t find a place where giving was rewarding and gave her a positive feeling and understand in where she has helped. Thus, the birth of Oaseit as an idea, and she found a passionate team to build the product. We are currently building our product and on track to launch in mid Sept 2018. We have successfully validated our product and gained a lot of interest. Our business model is to take a cut on the transaction crowdfunded to the projects. Our strategy is to gain low margins and high volume as it is important to get less from our customer each time, but rather engage the worried millennials more often.

A lot are made on factories powered by sun and wind. Everything is certified. The clothes are high quality, and the fabric breathes and feel great. All this for a medium to low price range. We started by pre-selling clothes for 170 000 NOK. In August we are on track to 200 000 NOK. Our vision is to invent the McDonald's of online shopping of ecologically friendly clothing. The What Transforming clothing consumption The How Back in the 80's the Aral Sea was the world's fourth largest lake. If Norway's largest lake is the size of a pea, the Aral Sea is a medicine ball. Or it was. Today the Aral Sea has shrunk to about 5 % of its original size. The main reason for the change is cotton plantations, and their huge irrigation systems. To produce a t-shirt you need 15 bath tubs with water, just to grow the cotton. To produce one t-shirt made of conventional cotton you need a water glass with highly toxic chemicals. Poor farmers get ill when spraying their fields with it. This means that they are no longer able to support their families. Every year, thousands take their own lives by drinking the same poison they use on the fields. Finding organic and ethical clothes that fits your style can be really hard. This is why Grønt Skift exist. My dream is to transform the state of clothing consumption worldwide. My mission is to invent the McDonald’s of online shopping of ecologically friendly clothing. My purpose is to make it easy and attractive to consume clothing in a way that safeguards and promotes the well-being for all living things. My Mission is to create a turnkey operation that systematically delivers on our Purpose, Vision and Dream. I started out in January 2016, with next to nothing in my name. Therefore my girlfriend (now wife) helped me and together we interviewed over 50 people. Together with the ones we identified as ideal customers we built a first selection of clothes that they where missing. We managed to pre-sell clothes for 170 000 NOK, which was enough to buy in a small stock, and launch over webshop. We have managed to build our business with back-order stock and with suppliers that traditionally have delivered to the printing marked. We are currently moving towards 150 000-200 000 NOK per month. It didn't take long before we started to receive questions about clothes for companies and organizations. We are now printing and delivering to organizations all over Norway.

With our software, anyone can create their own minimum viable platform in one day, and easily customize it to the unique needs of their particular concept. The What Fair and sustainable sharing economy The How Sharetribe was founded in 2011. The initial business idea was to allow anyone to create local sharing groups (""tribes"") for their neighborhoods, university campuses and other such local communities. In 2014, we pivoted to offering a white label tool that other entrepreneurs and organizations can use to build their ""Airbnb for X"" or ""Uber for Y"". Today our software products power more than 700 such platforms in 50 countries around the world. We charge a monthly subscription fee from the organizations running these platforms, and recently passed one million euros in annual revenue. Today the so-called sharing economy is controlled by VC-funded giants like Airbnb and Uber, that have created tremendous innovations, but don't always treat their users fairly. These platforms increase inequality and put large groups of people working through them in a precarious position. We want to democratize the sharing economy by making platform technology accessible to everyone. This means that people using the giant platforms have a choice: if they are not happy with the rules of a platform giant, they can go create their own platform instead. At the same time, we can bring the sharing economy to industries where it hasn't earlier been available, since the costs for setting up a platform have been too high, and the market hasn't been big enough to interest venture capitalists.

Our real-time workflow solutions are powered by a deep learning-based AI backbone that provide fully automated image analysis, initially of MRI brain scans. The What For hospitals and clinics who cannot keep up with demand for medical image diagnostics, Cerebriu Apollo is a software solution that improves productivity and quality. Hospitals and clinics that perform medical imaging diagnostics examinations are across the globe struggling to keep up with an ever increasing demand on radiology while maintaining a high level of quality in diagnostics Up to 60% of time is spent looking at healthy images Up to 30% of patients have no clinically relevant findings Up to 15% patients are recalled for further scanning Up to 15% time spent determining the medical protocol Mean time to report is often not better for critical patients than for healthy patients Patients may be applied contrast unnecessarily, especially by younger doctors The How Cerebriu Apollo aims at addressing different pain-points in the radiological workflow: Smart Protocol: Enable to automate brain MRI protocol sequences during scanning with minimal manual intervention. Cerebriu’s smart protocol will provide a real-time classification of critical candidate pathologies from which specialized protocols may be selected. Image Reporter: Enable automatic navigation to findings in the scan both in real-time (during scanning), and during image interpretation/reporting. Triage Advisor: As a biproduct of smart protocol, the radiologist will be able to prioritize report generation of patients based on the severity of the underlying pathology. Unlike competitors focusing on diagnostics during radiologist image reading or generating more data through magic sequences during scanning, we focus on simple workflow efficiency gains automating tasks that disturb radiologists, while improving the attention to the clinically relevant findings. The Why Over the past couple of decades, the growth of the global middle class in conjunction with the growth in use of medical imaging has been stretching radiology to the brink of collapse. Teleradiology centers in low-cost countries has augmented radiologists in developed countries, to allow developed countries continued access at a tolerable level of quality, but at the sacrifice of most of the world’s population. Over the next decade the demanding middle-class will grow from nearly 3 billion to 5 billion people. Radiologists are amongst the most stressed out and sick-leave stricken population of medical doctors. Much of their work is very repetitive and the workload is ever increasing. In developed countries radiologists report on 10-15 patients per day at an approx. 4% error rate, while in developing countries this production can supersede 50 patients per day with undisclosed error rates. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/medical-imaging-what-all-fuss-robert-lauritzen/",,3,People,,,

The What Change the fashion industry from inside The How The world is full of quality material going to problem waste. At the same time, new material for fashion goods is constantly produced on nature's cost. Big brands are lacking business models to utilise excess/deadstock material while small eco-brands lack scalability and high-end design qualities.

We are currently fundraising for a pilot-project in Peru with a local agriculture organisation that wants to co-create a solution for 500 avocado farmers. The What Sustainable Irrigation & Improved Yield The How Water is becoming the limiting factor in food production on a global level, the UN predicts that if we continue our current consumption of water in agriculture we will run 40% short on water within just 15 years and as 70% of the water is used for irrigation, it makes it extremely important to optimise irrigation. We have been able to deliver an affordable sensor system solution by taking the approach to create a minimal viable accuracy technology that will meet the demand. We are not developing advanced ferraris but reliable toyotas. Our main focus is to help farmers optimize their yield by enabling them to irrigate smarter by providing them with actionable, real time data of their field. We have established a relationship with two of the largest and well-renowned agricultural organisations in Peru with deep roots in the avocado farming industry. We have been strongly encouraged by these partners to establish a large-scale pilot project-cooperation in order to develop and test our new solution with 500 farmers spread across 2000 hectares over the course of the next 2 years. The project will have a huge impact on the local society as water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource which limits food productions thereby putting the income of small-scale farmers at risk. We expect to be able to save the community at least 10% water, while at the same time increasing their yield by another 10%, essentially leading to a net income increase of roughly 40% for the 500 small-scale farmers we will initially be working with.

We offer the whole value chain as a one integrated service, resulting in reliability, affordability and seamless user experience. All the while, tackling one of the most pressing challenges of modern times: clean and sustainable energy. The What Be cool and keep the planet cool as well. The How The electric vehicle revolution is on its way to hit the streets. Every major car manufacturer is now bringing mid-priced electric vehicles for mass markets. Some have even announced to end the production of gasoline cars. States in wide spectrum have decided to ban all new fossil fuel cars. As the prices go down, the adoption of electric vehicles can be as disruptive as the as for the smart phone outdating the older cell phone. Only one problem has remained: How to charge the car in real estate environment. The current method of installing single chargers here and there is expensive and cumbersome. Each new set of chargers implies a new project with electrical engineering, acquisition of chargers and electrical contracting. The limits of electrical distribution center can suddenly form a barrier for adding new chargers. These difficulties have prompted the experts to forecast that the problem of charging in real estate will substantially slow down the adoption of electric vehicles. That has been the case, until now. Parking Energy Platform solves all the issues with a single stroke. The crucial distinction is to separate the cabling from the chargers. In the heart of the solution is a quick connector: In a garage, the cabling can be brought to each slot, ending to a robust and inexpensive connector. When the tenant buys an electric vehicle, the charger can be ordered to the parking slot for the next day. The installment of a charger with fitting quick connector is plug-and-play. It takes only a minute and requires no electrical planning or composing official electrical installment records. The benefit for the real estate owner is twofold. First, a large parking area can be prepared to be EV-ready with a single investment. Second, the real estate is freed from managing the installment projects, maintenance and metering the electricity. The cost of the cabling is less than 1% of the cost of a parking slot, but can add value many times over. The Why Electric vehicle revolution: millions of affordable EVs will find their home in residential buildings and the parking lots of workplaces.",,7,Prosperity,,,

We want to provide fast connectivity to remote areas, and ensure a more efficient management of communication during emergencies. We do all this at a very small deployment cost. Software 4G and 5G mobile core network enables mobile communications with off the shelf LTE devices and uses Software Defined Network (SDN) technology to create different slices in the same infrastructure. The network slices can have different resources and traffic priorities for critical communications and isolate traffic with different Quality of Service. The mobile core run on Virtualized Network Functions (NFV) which allows to deploy and tear down the mobile core network based on demand. Mobile networks 4G and 5G require a large investment because they need a lot of computing resources and large server rooms. This is because the system has been designed for large deployments of millions of subscribers. Cumucore Oy has designed the same 4G/LTE mobile core network with smaller deployments in mind. This enables us to provide mobile connectivity to smaller areas having a population of 100.000 users or less. We believe connectivity is vital in this day and age, and want to provide it to remote areas at a very small deployment cost. The other problem we are solving is that often remote areas have networks lacking sufficient capacity. Our Software Defined Network technology analyses the network and creates smaller divisions or slices of the network. This management of the network is done dynamically so if there is an emergency, the system immediately will create the slice and isolate the critical communications from the rest of the network. However, if there is no emergency, then the entire network is available for everyone. The What Provide fast connectivity to remote areas, and enable efficient communication during emergencies. The How Cumucore brings a disruptive solution that integrates Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) to deliver a flexible and affordable mobile services to truly connect the world.

Our vision is to unlock coffee's health potential. The What There are over 9 billion kgs of coffee consumed worldwide yearly. Only 1% is extracted when brewing coffee water, 99% is thrown away. Mostly decomposing in landfills and generating methane, which is 30x more harmful than CO2. Moreover, every-increasing demand for natural products is damaging cosmetic formulators' bottom line, as these often come at premium prices. This affects society as a whole, as access to healthy natural products is made only for the wealthy. The How By building the 1st circular economy model around coffee. We provide a free recycling service for corporates in Copenhagen (cutting their waste management costs). Partner collector picks it up and takes it to our biorefinery (1st of its kind in the world - currently raising our Seed Round to build it). In here we fractionate coffee grounds into compounds (antioxidants, proteins, sugars, lipids) that allow us to produce ingredients - both new and existing - for the wellcare market. Due to the origin of our raw material, our costs are substantially lower than competitors. Hence, reflected on prices. Ex: current coffee oil wholesale price is 300 eur/kg, our price is 100 eur/kg and we retain more margins. 1 tonne recycled = 340m3 methane averted + 3 jobs created. Goal by Y1 after biorefinery establishment = 60 tonnes recycled per year. Y2 open an industrial biorefinery (65 tonnes per month in Germany or France). 1% profits for social projects to farmers in Colombia. The Why Founders studied in London. Most friends were Scandinavian, shared was a passion for coffee. Enjoyed a lot of “fikas” with amazing Colombian coffee. Often told them about the not-so-pretty side of coffee, e.g farmers’ conditions > they seemed genuinely interested in contributing in some way or another. They told us we should bring Colombian coffee to Scandinavia and the idea resonated with us. But, we didn’t want to come to Denmark just to sell coffee, but rather have an impact on farmers and environment in a way it has never been done before. This is when, since the beginning, we decided to build a circular economy around coffee. We remembered habits we saw our grandma’s doing while we grew up in Colombia. They used to put coffee on wounds + using them for skin care purposes. This encouraged us to look deeper into coffee’s composition, and most importantly, if all active compounds responsible for health and skin benefits were still present after coffee was made. And they are!",,"9,12,13,",,,,
2928,Elderlearn,https://www.elderlearn.dk/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/elderlearn-1,"The Pitch We facilitate contact between foreigners learning danish and elderly people at risk of loneliness. We do this for two reasons. Firstly we believe that having a normal conversation is the best way to learn a language once you know the basics. More importantly we believe that enabling even the weakest of the elderly to help other people and feel a sense of worth will efficiently combat loneliness. The What Combat loneliness and ease integration The How I wrote my master thesis on loneliness in nursing homes and found that loneliness would be most efficiently prevented by giving the elderly a sense of worth by being able to help others. Searching for away they could help i recalled having worked in a nursing home in Essen, Germany, before an exchange semester, in order to learn German. Thus the idea behind Elderlearn came to life. We want to make sure that the elderly see themselves as having worth for society. We want to make it easy and fun to learn Danish. We also want to change the perception of the elderly from being a burden to being a ressource for society. Further we take great joy in connecting two groups that would normally never meet. We hope that more understanding and a better perception of both foreigners and elderly will arise, through the concrete meetings and through media attention. We make sure both foreigners and elderly sign up, facilitate the first meeting and follow up on how they are doing. Our customers are municipalities and we provide them with reporting of our work in their municipality. The municipalities are responsible for integration and elderly care. Loneliness has been a focus point lately and they welcome a fresh approach to tackle this. Currently they pay pr. match. In the long run it will likely be a subscription fee. We have arranged for more than a 150 pairs to be set in contact. We have grown from one to 6 people since starting in September last year (2 full time, 4 part time, 5 salaried). We have 4 paying municipalities and support from a charitable fund. We are currently developing a back-end IT-system that will automate as much of our work as possible. Since we are working with elderly people we have designed a system that they will not have to interact with. The foreigners learning danish will have some interactions through automated e-mails and texts, but the system is mainly back-end. The Why We want everyone learning Danish to visit elderly people, and make sure the elderly feel beneficial to society.",,"3,11,",,,,
2929,Yepti,https://yepti.dk/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/yepti-1,"The Pitch Yepti is a newly relaunched sharing-economy platform aiming to empower people through affordable access to specialist equipment. We seek to be part of the solution to the economic, social, and environmental problems faced by all of us here in Denmark and beyond. The What Reducing consumption through sharing The How Overconsumption is one of the most pressing factors in environmental impact, the greatest challenge facing us all today. We need to reduce our consumption of resources in order to protect the world we share. Everything we buy has a high environmental cost in its production, and a high financial cost for us as consumers. Yet there are so many things that we need in our daily lives, for work, and for our projects. A musician may ask themself: ‘do I need an amplifier for my next gig’? A photographer might ask: ‘do I need a faster portrait lens for a low-light wedding shoot’? You may take a look at your apartment floorboards and think: ‘do I need an electric sander to smooth this surface’? The answer to all of these types of questions will most often be ‘yes’ - but the answer comes with high costs - both environmental and financial. What we need, then, is a way of mitigating these costs. The solution to lowering these costs becomes apparent when we ask an additional question: ‘do I need to own this item’. The answer here, is most often ‘no’. Yet despite the fact that we live in a shared world, we have not yet fully embraced the fact that we must share its resources in order to preserve it. We still feel driven to own and to consume. Yepti provides a sharing platform which removes this ownership factor. Sharing specialist equipment amongst ourselves makes it more accessible and affordable, and reduces our impact on the environment by minimising consumption. Those of us with the most resources have a responsibility to be on the frontier of this sharing-economy development. The Why Redefining ownership and reducing consumption by revolutionising the sharing-economy.",,"11,12,",,,,

The product has a double function, as it creates shade while simultaneously generating electricity through capturing solar power. Installing solar curtains is an excellent way for private individuals and corporates to reduce electricity expenses as well as allowing for more self-sufficiency of buildings. The What To pave the way for a renewable society The How We design and develop solar shades with an integrated energy design that can help your company or household minimise its carbon footprint, by harnessing both solar energy and indoor light source.

The solar cell threads can be embedded in variety of substrates such as facade, glass, vehicle composite etc. By choosing appropriate substrate, we can customize solar cell products for different applications with unique features. The What Affordable and flexible solar cells made from fine solar cell threads The How Our team has developed a technique to refine silicon to solar grade threads by melt drawing silicon powder within glass cladding. The main advantage of the technique is that it reduces manufacturing costs by 50%. The silicon threads are mono crystalline silicon with the potential to reach efficiency of 23%. In addition, the silicon threads are flexible to a diameter of 5mm, and compatible with a variety of substrates appropriate for different applications including building facades, carbon composites of cars and trains. By making solar energy more affordable and desirable for customers, we aim to decrease the share of fossil fuels in energy consumption. The fabrication technology of this product is another ‘green’ aspect. The conventional silicon refining reactors are costly and sawing ingots to wafers wastes about half the material. While the silicon dust can be recycled, the energy used to form that portion of the ingot is lost. The alternative semiconductor materials contain toxic elements and are not suitable for a wide range of uses.

2947,Marine Performance Systems,https://www.marineperformancesystems.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/marine-performance-systems,"We enable the shipowner's transition to Green Shipping. Our advanced Fluidic Air Lubrication technology reduces fuel consumption, emissions, and fouling, enabling Shipowners and Ship Operators to reduce operating costs by 10-20% and contribute to a better environment. The Shipping Industry is transitioning to Green Shipping, driven by strict environmental regulations and a tight time frame. By 2050, Shipping has to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions. However, a shipowner cannot replace the existing fleet overnight, and is forced to use high grade fuel at a premium prize to be compliant, while competing in a low margin industry, where fuel costs represent 50-60% of a ship’s operating costs and fuel consumption is directly linked to GHG emissions. We can help the shipowner to offset the cost of transitioning to Green Shipping, retrofitting the existing fleet to lower fuel consumption 10-20% with 2-3 years' payback period. Our solution, FluidicAL, is an advanced fluidic air lubrication technology that reduces the ship’s friction, when sailing, effectively lowering fuel consumption thus operating costs by 10-20%. A side effect of air lubrication is that fouling on ship is reduced, further lowering the fuel consumption and GHG emissions. FluidicAL is patented and is unique, because of how it significantly improves how the air layer is created and maintained underneath the ship’s hull, covering the largest area of the flat bottom with the highest efficiency available on the market. FluidicAL requires no structural modifications or recertification, can be upgraded post installation, and is designed to last the life time of the vessel. FluidicAL consists of bands with the dimensions of 5cm x 80cm x width of the ship, that are evenly spaced (4-6 bands/ship) underneath the ship, welded to the hull during scheduled dry docking in 8-10 days. These bands generate and maintain an air layer, consisting of 240.000 air bubbles/second per running meter band without mechanical parts. The unique feature of FluidicAL is our patented technology, which enables high degree of control over air bubbles size, flow, and distribution. The merchant fleet consists of 91,000 ships, where the environmental potential is highest if retrofitting the largest ships, bulk carriers, tankers, container ships etc. Our ambition is to become market leader with a 10% market share of the retrofitting of the Large and Very Large ships, that represent a potential of €8.6Bn across 6,400 vessels, where 20% annually will enter a dry dock for maintenance and upgrading. Marine Performance Systems (MPS); a Danish-Dutch maritime technology and marine engineering company with more than 10 years' industry experience. The founders are experienced in technology development and marine engineering, and known in the Shipping Industry. We are driven by a vision to provide integrated solutions that significantly reduce the Shipping Industry’s operating costs and environmental footprint. FluidicAL is the first of such a solution, representing an expected environmental impact per ship of approx 7.000 metric tonnes of fuel savings and 22.000 metric tonnes CO2 reduced.",Hellerup,"9,13,14,",,,,

In other words, by utilizing our technology, the illumination of empty streets may be minimized while still providing the occasional pedestrian or car a well lit field of view. Compared to traditional lighting control, we save up to 80 % of the energy consumed by outdoor lighting without compromising public safety or comfortability gained by lighting. The What Street lighting = Smart lighting The How Lumine was founded by three students from different engineering background. The idea behind Lumine was born from a cross-country skiing path which was well lit but rarely used. Santeri Oksanen thought this was waste of energy and started building Lumine's team which few years after that launched the first smart lighting project in Espoo. First years went by developing the solution and providing information to city officials about smart lighting. Over 4 years have gone by and now Lumine's solutions is utilized in pedestrian streets, bicycle streets, roads and several other sights in over 15 cities. Lumine control system provides energy savings between 40 and 80 %. In addition to financial savings and reduced carbon footprint, Lumine's solution also eliminates excess light pollution. This is done via Lumine 180 control unit which is sold directly to cities and agencies who are responsible of street lighting. We are offering two main products: Lumine 180 is installed on the pole so it can be used with any led-luminaire. Lumine 180 INT has the same functionalities with Lumine 180 except it will be installed inside the luminaire to reduce the installation cost of the unit. Most of our business is hardware sales but in addition we collect a maintenance fee of the smart lighting service. Our goal is to be the biggest smart lighting provider in the Nordic countries within next three years. In addition to smart lighting we are looking to provide other services through our wireless network. For example we are able to calculate the traffic in every pole to be utilized in city planning. Also additional sensors and cameras in the network can provide essential information for road maintenance.

Being mobile opens up new financing options and makes hard to reach places accessible. The energy created replaces costly and polluting diesel. Cheaper energy will help societies reduce the average amount of “hard” work required to sustain a given living standard, freeing up time for more valuable pursuits. The What Renewable energy through kites The How We are building a new type of flying wind turbine that can make wind power accessible for many more locations, as well as significantly cheaper. It utilises drone technology to autonomously control a flying wing tethered to the ground, and this wing acts as the blade of a traditional wind turbine. Because it needs no tower, only a small foundation and uses its “blades” (the wings) much more efficiently, it only needs a fraction of the material of a conventional system, for the same power output. This is where costs are saved, and it is the reason it can be installed almost anywhere, without large cranes and other expensive infrastructure.

Cure Bionics's Story
It all started in 2016 when they participated in a student challenge to solve problems in relation to the SDGs. One of the team members at that time had a cousin who was born without both her upper limbs and her parents couldn’t afford to buy her prosthetics until she reaches the age of 20 and her morphology stops growing. They made a mechanical prosthetic device at that time but we, unfortunately, didn’t agree to continue.

Mohammed, the founder of Cure Bionic, decided to take it as his graduation project in 2017 instead of a paid internship in Canada and I used his family’s financial resources to rebuild a bionic arm from scratch. It took him 8 months where he met many people with limb differences and started having them as friends. He was visiting a hospital in Tunisia where they take care of children with amputation and met an 8-year child who was electrified and lost both his right hand and leg, he was in pain, and his mum was so in a very bad situation since they cannot afford to buy a prosthetic hand for him. That day, Mohammed took a decision to address children with amputation who did not have access to these devices because they are not made small enough, because their parents cannot afford to supply them with it since it is so expensive or because existing prosthetics will not reflect their personality and preferences to make them feel proud of having such devices. He took the decision to give them more than a device, but a way to inspire the world with their positive differences.",,3,People,,,

Their device incorporates sensors and motion analysis to recognize walking patterns. The device is intended to provide paraplegics with a comfortable walk on indoor spaces to help them access toilets and other utilities in a home/office environment. This reduces the terrain variations and the complexities associated with it, bringing down the cost of the product.

Astrek Innovation's Story
They started working on this startup after having a personal accident. Astrek Innovations team used to work together in a volunteering organization and they used to work together for 5 years. Two years back the grandfather of Robin, one of the founders, had an accident. He was a really healthy and independent man, but after the accident, he couldn’t walk again. After doing the operation in records he was completely healthy to walk, but he didn’t. They used to carry him to the toilets, he was no more independent.

Astrek Innovations team used to develop assistive devices for daily living for specially-abled schools back then. They thought they will use rehabilitation solutions to make him walk but everything was costly and they couldn’t use anything. They came up together to develop a solution to this. Robin’s grandfather died two years back but they are working on this because they see so many people around them and they want to bring changes in their life.",,9,Prosperity,,,

Scientific studies have proven that the use of stereotypic language when writing job ads is common practice, and this has a psychological effect on potential applicants. Such language makes these job ads biased towards specific demographic groups, discouraging other groups from applying and this effect can reduce the applicant pool by as much as 50%.

Their solution, the DD-scan is an AI-based software tool that promotes inclusive writing which will enable you to reach a wider and more diverse talent pool. The DD-scan detects and color-highlights implicitly and explicitly stereotypic language in your texts and suggests neutral alternatives in real-time. This way, their customers have attracted 3x more qualified candidates regardless of gender, ethnicity, or age, and save time on recruitment.

Their vision is to empower companies to make diversity the new norm in every company.

These prosthetics are customizable thanks to removable covers, having rotating wrist, easy to use thanks to a smart algorithm, adjustable since children grow fast, having wireless/solar charger, and will be sold for an affordable price.
They also aim to provide them with an entertaining and immersive therapeutic solution that uses virtual reality and gamification allowing them, using a VR headset and a muscle bracelet, to see and control a virtual hand for training and rehabilitation via gamified exercises while the doctor can do the online follow up from his office while getting real-time and accurate data.

Cure Bionics's Story
It all started in 2016 when they participated in a student challenge to solve problems in relation to the SDGs. One of the team members at that time had a cousin who was born without both her upper limbs and her parents couldn’t afford to buy her prosthetics until she reaches the age of 20 and her morphology stops growing. They made a mechanical prosthetic device at that time but we, unfortunately, didn’t agree to continue.

Mohammed, the founder of Cure Bionic, decided to take it as his graduation project in 2017 instead of a paid internship in Canada and I used his family’s financial resources to rebuild a bionic arm from scratch. It took him 8 months where he met many people with limb differences and started having them as friends. He was visiting a hospital in Tunisia where they take care of children with amputation and met an 8-year child who was electrified and lost both his right hand and leg, he was in pain, and his mum was so in a very bad situation since they cannot afford to buy a prosthetic hand for him. That day, Mohammed took a decision to address children with amputation who did not have access to these devices because they are not made small enough, because their parents cannot afford to supply them with it since it is so expensive or because existing prosthetics will not reflect their personality and preferences to make them feel proud of having such devices. He took the decision to give them more than a device, but a way to inspire the world with their positive differences.",,10,Prosperity,,,

3113,Study Rocket ,,https://technation.io/insights/tech-for-social-good/,"At Study Rocket, we’ve decided to make all of our content totally free for everyone to use, forever. The site will now stay as it is and be open for anyone to use. Instead, the team are now focusing fully on building the amazing revision timetable app — Adapt.
What is Adapt?
Adapt is a dynamic A-level & GCSE revision timetable app that makes your plan for you. Having been designing Adapt since January, we’re currently building the app over the summer, launching a Beta in September and becoming open to you all in January.
Why?
We believe the real problem we can solve for students isn’t content (you already have tons of that) but disorganisation. After all, how many of you plan your revision on paper or a normal calendar only to find out you can’t stick to it?",,4,People,,,
