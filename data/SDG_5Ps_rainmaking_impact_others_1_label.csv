With years of experience in the logistics sector we operate a sustainable logsitics network in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and are currently working on expanding it throughout Europe. We go as far as offering solutions for *Software Development* We're currently developing software that will enable us and our network to automatically dispatch shipments to be transported as efficiently as possible, both ecologically and economically. Alongside GPS-data and nodes, CO2-emssion and working conditions will be measured and displayed in the software to give a more detailed track&trace than what we're used to from other integrators. Our ultimate goal is to be able to provide our own operation as well as our network with a full-fledged software package giving us the competitive edge over conventional providers. *Engineering* For our own fleets as well as for our network we're working on a Predictive Maintenance solution for professional sustainable logistics vehicles. To be able to operate large fleets of relatively light vehicles it is essential to have a working maintenance and service plan. To be able to predict defects and service intervals we're working on a cost effective sensor array backed by an AI.

1210,1210,Movildrive,https://movildrive.com/,Rainmaking,"MovilDrive es una empresa creada en Marzo de 2018 para el desarrollo de software de aplicaciones de móvil en los sectores tecnológicos más disruptivos de hoy en día como Connected-Car, Smart-City y ADAS ADAS proviene de Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems, y es el sector en el que se ha formado el socio fundador CEO de MovilDrive, Alberto Lebrón durante los últimos años en Alemania. El objetivo fundamental es el de crear innovación a través del desarrollo Software. Por eso, hemos detectado varios problemas de hoy en día en el centro de Madrid (y en otras grandes ciudades) y hemos comenzado a desarrollar una primera solución para ayudar a resolver este reto. En el sitio web: https://movildrive.com/soluciones.html planteamos nuestra primera solución básica para PYMES y Autónomos para Android / iOS. Se trata de un Car-Sharing eléctrico con vehículos grandes para trabajadores de PYMES y Autónomos y tambíen para particulares. El modelo de negocio está basado en un Car-Sharing, muy extendido en los últimos años, que se podría segmentar entre particulares y empresas. El mercado está validado por diversos estudios y conocidas firmas de consultoría y muestra oportunidad de negocio hasta 2030 debido a las nuevas leyes sobre contaminación CO2 y las normativas europeas para fabricar vehículos eléctricos de todas las marcas :) Aún no existe una solución de Van-Sharing para pequeños empresarios y autónomos que tienen que hacer sus repartos o realizar sus servicios cada diario en el centro de Madrid y Barcelona, y esto les crea un problema a la hora de moverse, encontrar aparcamiento y acceso al centro. Además de las multas que estos pequeños empresarios tienen que pagar por trabajar que hace que las performance de sus negocios y sus ganancias se vean afectadas, repercutiendo directamente al bolsillo de los responsables del negocio a final de mes. Por eso planteamos esta primera solución, para ayudar a los trabajadores de todos los sectores PYMES, y donde cubriremos usuarios profesionales, autónomos y usuarios particulares que podrán usar nuestras furgonetas eléctricas por la ciudad a diaria y los fines de semana. Una de las ventajas competitivas que ofrecemos respecto a otras empresas es la posibilidad de desarrollar una App con Inteligencia Artificial y Deep-Learning para detectar objetos urbanos y envíar notificaciones al usuario y al coche a través de alertas en su Smart-Phone. (Sector Connected-Car y Smart-City) Otro posible uso sería para aseguradores donde podríamos guardar datos de conducción del usuario (de la flota o empresa) identificando situaciones de distracción al volante y conducciones irregulares para avisar al conductor a través de alertas e indicar medidas más seguras al volante. La primera App básica ya está en Google Play y ha sido desarrollada por el fundador junto con dos becarios de programación, y en un tiempo record hemos integrado una solución completa de car-sharing, con monitoreo y tracking de vehículos en Tiempo Real. El primer vehículo Movildrive también está ya disponible y tiene más de 10 usuario en menos de 1 mes: https://movildrive.com/comofunciona.html En adelante queremos ampliar nuestro equipo para traer con nosotros a desarrolladores de Java y de iOS que tengan experiencia en Machine Learning, además de un técnico de Márketing y SEO para llevar a cabo nuestras primeras campañas de márketing online y publicidad. Aunque nuestro primer Movildrive es una Berlingo Eléctrica, dejaremos al inversor que elija el modelo de furgón eléctrico en el que quiere invertir (Nissan NV200, Peugeot Partner Eléctrica, Kangoo ZE, etc) Nuestro Pitch-Deck para el primer MVP en fase Seed cuenta únicamente con los gastos de estos desarrolladores que se incorporen para ayudar al desarrollo de las App más avanzadas, y la primera flota de 10 vehículos. Las primeras figuras KPI de Julio 2018 aseguran la rentabilidad del negocio, y aunque aún es muy pronto para hacer un analisis finaciero, establece un retorno de la inversión mínimo del 50% sin haber hecho ninguna campaña de marketing ni de publicidad en estos momentos. Al Break-Even o Punto de Equilibrio se llegaría en menos de tres años, ofreciendo rentabilidad a partir del primer día, y desde ese momento solo ganancia, con vehículos eléctricos con poco mantenimiento y tan solo un recambio de las baterías entre los 5-7 años. El Plan de Negocio ha sido realizado para un equipo de 5px y con flotas de 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 y 300+ vehículos eléctricos y se han analizado todos los escenarios posibles con cifras reales. Nuestra estrategia en este momento, es ir paso a paso, comprobando que el negocio es escalable, y pasar de una flota pequeña a otras mayores en función del retorno de la inversión y de la respuesta de nuestros usuarios.",Spain,13,Planet,13.4 Decarbonised Transport,"Movilidad Eléctrica Conectada para trabajadores de PYMES, Autónomos y usuarios Particulares","paris, milano, londres, marsella, madrid, roma, bruselas, copenhague, barcelona"

According to the World Health Organization (WHO): “285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246 have low vision. 80% of all visual impairment can be avoided or cured”. Early diagnosis and follow-up treatments is necessary to prevent eye diseases from turning into blindness. - Early diagnosis is limited by the ability to make 3D OCT images of the eye. OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique used extensively by eye specialists to obtain cross-sectional images of the eye for diagnosis and treatment. Today; it is only possible to make partial 3D OCT images of the eye as the eye constantly moves. The current technology is not fast enough to take a full image of the eye within those small movements. Full 3D OCT images of the eye is necessary to assess the condition of the eye and to ensure that nothing is overlooked.

Savings avoiding deep infiltration, savings avoiding evaporation, the plant only takes by capillarity what it needs. Close to 100% efficiency. 40-50% Fertilizer saving: the fertilizer is dissolved in the irrigation water. 20-40% Phytosanitary saving: No water-logging is generated in the soil, so this prevents the germination of weeds and the proliferation of pests and diseases. 20-40% Saves energy by reducing the volume of water to be pumped, transported. Labor saving, the reduction of wetness in soil avoids the proliferation of weeds that need not be removed, it also reduces costs of eliminating such waste. Reducing fertilizer use improves the saturation of nitrates in the sea and aquifers. It does not need high pressure so the energy bill is reduced in some cases. Reducing water use: reduces salinization of soil and aquifers by marine intrusion. Less humidity is generated in greenhouses so there are fewer fungal infections and less condensation.

This leads to an increased need for investment in new electricity power supply and other infrastructure measures. - - - At the same time an increasing number of electric vehicles charged via the electricity grid will lead to a growing battery capacity for electrical energy. This new resource will also increase the potential for utilising locally produced solar electricity. The load on the grid will be reduced while the potential for new production of solar electricity increases. - Charging points will be certified for using solar electricity primarily from local or owned production. If locally produced solar energy is not available; the charging point will be supplied with solar power from other producers through issued guarantees of origin. Charging electric vehicles at a certified solar charging point can be sure to always get 100% solar. - If a solar power installation is connected directly to the charging points the vehicles can be charged with higher power when the sun is shining; which requires a straight-forward control. The self consumption can be increased and the purchased electricity reduced. With so-called forecast control the charging can also be controlled by the estimated future solar radiation. With Solarcharge Systems charging peak loads can also be avoided during high electricity prices; or when other needs must be prioritised.,Developed Markets

You can prevent problems and boost positive changes together with your team, but also react fast enough in the new remote working conditions. *Why is this important?* The modern work life has become stressful already before the COVID19 pandemic and the future aftermath of it. During the last decades the mental virus of exhaustion, stress and burnouts (including early retirements due to mental illnesses) has spread globally like viruses in real-life. Now facing the pandemic, people are working in new conditions and under a lot of extra stress during the pandemic. This will affect people’s mental health and wellbeing but also businesses’ and organizations’ ability to perform during the crisis and when recovering from it. According to the research by Dr. Wilmar Schaufeli,[the burnout rate in the EU was close to 10 % (https://www.wilmarschaufeli.nl/publications/Schaufeli/500.pdf) and it varied between 4,3 % (Finland) and 20,6 % (Slovenia). Not recently done, but the Last deep-dive in the EU showed that the cost of burnout and exhaustion is at least €20 billion (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336011) per year. According to another study, the cost of stress is more than €600 billion in the EU (https://www.eurocadres.eu/stress-at-work-a-cost-to-reduce/) per year. The number of burnouts and the costs associated will surely increase now in the pandemic crisis and current working conditions. We don’t yet have enough data on the impact and costs of the current crisis. HR and leadership are also facing new challenges. They have too much workload already and are failing to support the work communities. They need help in assessing the mental wellbeing issues, spotting emerging problems early on, and focusing their support and efforts on those teams and people who need it the most. But it is not only HR who needs support in this new situation. We ALL need support today and when facing the long-term effects of the pandemic. Even if you still can continue working, you have to learn new ways of organizing your work, collaborating with your team, and balancing work and family. At the same time, stress and anxiety have increased, but we all are more alone than ever before and have to tackle these issues in isolation. We need more support at work and we long for the social relationships with our friends, families, colleagues, and customers. It’s now harder to get any support from colleagues or supervisors with limited or no connection with them.

In contrast to the closest competitors in the market, we are operating on the prevention side - helping food businesses optimize their operations while aiding them in the reduction of overproduction and waste. The background of the project is based on thorough research on waste in the food industry, mapping out current processes and assessing user needs as well as the market potential. According to Project Drawdown (2020), food waste reduction has the potential to reduce global emissions by 88 gigatons by 2050 - making it the most effective way to combat climate change. According to ReFED (2020), the biggest sources of food waste come from stakeholders at the end of the value chain - households and consumer-facing food businesses. As a result, we are targeting consumer-facing businesses as they are responsible for approximately 40% of all food waste. They also have a financial incentive in reducing what is thrown out. Forecasting is one of the major issues to be solved. Today, food businesses are forecasting predominantly based on experience and gut-feeling.

2187,2187,Re:newcell,https://renewcell.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/renewcell,"We make fashion sustainable. Before a shirt is worn for the first time it has been through more steps than most customers realize. Often one producer makes the yarn, another knits or weaves it into textile fabric, and a third makes the shirt from the fabric. Now it’s ready for the customer to wear.When garments are worn out or no longer wanted some are sold second-hand or used as hand-me-downs, but the vast majority end up in landfills or are incinerated. Much too few are recycled due to the fact that cotton and viscose can’t be recycled with satisfactory quality on a large enough scale. The cycle stops, because there is a hole in the loop, a crucial part is missing. Our recycling technology dissolves used cotton and other natural fibers into a new, biodegradable raw material, Circulose pulp. It can be turned into textile fiber, be fed into the textile production cycle and meet industry specifications. This is the link that has been missing from the cycle. We have closed the loop. The way fashion is produced and consumed can finally be transformed into a never-ending loop. If the world’s population increases as expected, there will be 8.5 billion people by 2030. And as the population grows, apparel consumption grows with it. But producing even more apparel will have significant impact on water use, CO2 emissions, use of chemicals and waste disposal. It’s not sustainable. Something has to change. Our process of recycling cotton fibers and viscose fibers uses less water and chemicals, emits less CO2 and prolongs the usage of the world’s resources. More used cotton garments can be collected and the volume of garments made from our recycled, biodegradable textile fibers can increase. If one kilo of clothing is recycled instead of being produced from virgin sources, it saves thousands of liters of water and decreases emissions of both CO2 and chemicals.",Sweden,12,Prosperity,,,

The crop uses a lot of water, but many growers are in areas where there is little rainfall. It takes around 11 000 litres of unpolluted water to grow 1 kilogram of cotton. That means a single t-shirt requires as much as 2700 litres of water. We don't make our products from virgin material. Instead, Pure Waste recycles the offcuts and spinning waste from clothing and textile industries. The raw material is collected, sorted by colour and quality, and mechanically opened back into the fibre. Then we mix it with recycled polyester or viscose and spin it into new yarns. After that, the process is the same as with virgin materials except that our yarns and fabrics don’t need to be dyed as their colour comes from the textile waste. “Pure Waste” is our promise to use only materials that would otherwise go to waste.

We provide a platform that connects clinics with their patients. Childhood obesity is a major global health issue leading to cognitive and psychosocial problems and several non-communicable diseases. “Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century” – Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, WHO. Successful childhood obesity treatment brings on a life-style change resulting in a sustainable weight after an initial relative weight loss. There are effective traditional methods but they require almost weekly meetings with the caregivers (USPSTF 2017), something that the families struggle to handle and the society cannot afford on any significant scale. We bring on a new treatment paradigm based on measurable outcome instead of process goals. This lowers the risk of giving incorrect advice and reduces the stress associated with treatment. Our program is enabled by data collected at home. The data is presented to the families in a way that promotes self-management of health, while it’s presented to the healthcare professionals in order for them to intervene in the pivotal moments for their patients’ success. More patients can thus be treated with a fraction of the resources per patient compared to traditional methods. Our clinical results are outstanding and have been verified in clinical trials. The clinics’ benefits The clinics get an overview of all their registered patients and their progress as well as access to built in tools for planning and managing their work. Evira makes it possible for the clinics to continually keep track of their patients and intervene in the pivotal moments for their success. The revolutionary aspect with the Evira treatment concept is that it is based on reliably measured outcome instead of self-reported behaviour. Evira is a tool to provide treatment but we are also integrating manuals and recommendations that makes it possible for any clinic to work in an effective manner. Evira makes it possible for clinics to provide effective treatment with a fraction of the resources per patient compared to current/traditional methods. The families’ awareness of their progress makes the process less stigmatized which makes the visits more focused. The reduced stigmatization and continuous contact also leads to fewer late cancellations and missed appointments – which are significant cost drivers for clinics today. The families’ benefits The families get an easy way of getting in touch with the clinic for assistance through the mobile application as well as access to scientifically validated educational material.

It’s difficult to estimate the cost of time and money for developing a sharing platform from scratch, but a simple marketplace with standard features such as user handling, listing management, booking and payment may take from 500 to 800 hours of development. The founders of Cowedo experienced these issues when planning to launch three different sharing platforms. How could this be done smarter and more efficiently? Analyzing the concepts and comparing acceptance criteria for the different platforms we discovered that most of the features were common and a minor part was custom. So the development of the sharing engine began. Using the sharing engine, anyone can create a new sharing economy site. Getting access to a no-code peer-to-peer marketplace builder and designers, a sharing site can be launched in hours by configuration. The sharing engine enables short time-to-market and saves you the IT costs. Another problem about the sharing economy today is the lack of operability between existing platforms. Only a few actors within the sharing economy are collaborating. We want to make it possible for the end users to combine goods and services across all marketplaces in the Cowedo Network.",Oslo,12,Prosperity,,,

Being transparent to all wavelengths, graphene represents the ideal substrate and transparent contact for ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs). Nanowires on graphene enables critical improved internal quantum efficiency, operating lifetime, and reliability, especially for UVC. The result is UV LEDs with higher efficiency at significantly lower cost, resulting in a reduced cost performance ratio of more than a factor of 10. The cost performance ratio is defined as the price paid per watt of UVC output. Improving efficiency, reducing the energy consumption, and introducing this cost advantage will radically enable new applications and improve critical applications such as water and food processing disinfection, air purification and environmental monitoring and life science measurements. In addition, the use of the graphene substrate technology allows for substantial cost reduction of the UVC LED manufacturing process.",Norway,7,Prosperity,,,

We aim to create natural, desirable and safe alternative to existing contraceptive products. Our goal is to uphold the radical ideals that fueled the initial birth control movement. No longer should we accept the side effects that have become normalized by hormonal birth control. Nor the inconvenience of existing alternatives. OUI is embracing innovation to expand freedom for women. In this pursuit, we should not settle for anything less than revolutionary. OUI is a vaginal capsule that after insertion rapidly dissolves and releases the formulation. It is targeted to provide effective birth control a minute after insertion and for up to 1 day without the use of any hormones. OUI makes cervical mucus temporarily impenetrable to sperm. The barrier is established by a molecule that strongly interacts with cervical mucus and thereby reinforce the mucus to make it impenetrable for sperm cells. Sperm cells are trapped in the cervical mucus and maintained in the vaginal cavity where the low pH environment of the vagina deactivates them.",København,3,People,,,

The software is fed through sensors/microchips with data for energy production, load, the current pricing of electricity and storage data ensuring a tailored real-time optimization and prediction model for each connected system. This leads to better reliability, affordability and environmental friendliness of a customer’s microgrid. Besides the known problem that 36% of global final energy consumption and 42,5 % of globally CO2 Emissions is caused by electricity generation. We face additional issues such as the lack of electricity globally as well in Sweden, where urban areas outgrow capacities and new connections being refused to avoid blackouts. Most famously is the case of Pagen, which could not expand their factory in Malmö due to the concern of the city not being able to meet the additional energy demand. Furthermore, renewable energy is intermittent and difficult to control due to the nature of renewable energy sources such as sudden increase and decrease of energy production which affects the reliability and sustainability of the grid. In light of those issues that we face, we have created an AI with machine learning called the Hyve. The Hyve acts as the brain of a microgrid which is a system connected to for example renewable energy sources and energy storage in the form of a battery or for long term storage a hydrogen tank. The software is fed through sensors/microchips with data for energy production, load, the current pricing of electricity and wind data ensuring a tailored optimization and prediction model for each connected system. The Hyve automatically makes a decision when to buy/sell electricity, use electricity and store the energy to the storage. With our self-improving machine learning algorithm, the microgrid automatically becomes more efficient and effective over time, leading to cost savings for the customer by up to 30% compared to existing microgrid system with battery. Our software is a plug and play solution, ensuring that also single households with smaller microgrids are able to connect their systems easily to our solution. With The Hyve we aim to decrease the demand of energy from the grid, leading to a relief of the tense situation on the energy market, where we face a shortage of energy supply both locally and globally. Due to the fact that we use renewable energy, we will be able to reduce or completely eliminate the CO2 emissions caused by energy for buildings. Additionally, with our solution, we enable efficient use of renewables which eliminates the intermittency of renewables and gives the user maximum control of their microgrid.",Sweden,7,Prosperity,,,

The What Preschools in Sweden faces major challenges; it is subject to increased demands on quality, results and scrutiny, while it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit qualified preschool teachers. At the same time, Swedish preschool is ranked among the best in the world and many other countries are sneaking up on our educational system as they develop their own childcare, and the Swedish preschool model can be a way of ensuring the UN's global goal of ensuring that all girls and boys have access to good quality preschool. The How Through our topp Fokus Förskola, edChild digitizes the educational knowledge within Swedish preschools with the aim of facilitating many of the challenges we see in the preschool world. We enable educators, regardless of background knowledge, to quickly develop competence around the preschool assignment and to get concrete examples of how they can work with the children educationally.

The What Food waste is an enormous sustainability issue. Denmark alone wastes 700,000 tons of food each year. At Kanpla, we care about food waste in school canteens. Without knowing how many people will eat a given meal, canteens have to prepare more food than necessary. Canteens are wasting dozens of kilograms of food every day, and studies show that there is a potential for improvement.

It's a fully programmable & automated clean air system scaling up to any needs. CAaaS model includes indoor air quality monitoring, high-end air purifiers, central management via cloud and expert analysis. The What We can survive 30 days without food - for developed countries, one can always choose not to eat rotten food. We can survive 3 days without water - for us, bottled water is available option for places, where the tap water is not clean. But we can only survive 3 minutes without air. We are forced to breathe the air, no matter how polluted it is. According to WHO, each year millions of people die as a result of being exposed to bad air quality. The ultra fine particles generated by traffic and burning, are so small, they can penetrate to our blood stream via our lungs. Air pollution will then affect to our health causing lung cancer and other lung diseases, heart attacks and stroke, as well as other, less severe health issues, such as headache, nausea, fatigue and flu. For our market, there are two big issues causing polluted indoor air; very polluted outdoor air, which leaks indoors effectively (e.g. in China) and sick building syndrome (e.g. in Finland).

The What Every year, in the private gardens of Denmark, 5 million kilos of apples fall from trees and are abandoned. On the island of Fyn (Funen, eng) there is a long-standing tradition of handing in surplus fruit to the cidery in Ørbæk where apple donors sign a paper stating that no pesticides have been used. This is ecology and old school reduction of food waste without a label. This year we have filled some of our fermentation tanks with juice from these crispy garden apples of Fyn. We also use selected varieties from Lilleø for our small-batch cuvées. At Decideret Cider we do cider workshops and DIY-courses as well with the sustainable initiative GroSelv and Meyers Madhus – because real cider is in fact something everyone in possession of good apples can make. We are also one of the initiators and organizers behind Rigtig Cider - Copenhagen Cider Festival. The How In Denmark we are blessed with apples that balances a tart acidity with a fruitful apple sweetness. Our cider culture is on the other hand depleted. Our food culture has been elevated with the new nordic kitchen - now it is time to take a look at what we drink. We crush and press apples, ferment juice into cider, and bottle it by hand in small and big bottles - cider can be kept well in both a wine cellar and in a breast pocket. Some ciders are to be drunk young and fresh with a full throttle apple flavour. Other ciders gain flavour when aged in oak. For all our ciders we can say that they are wild fermented and they are made solely from Danish apples with a focus on craftsmanship, curiosity and reducing food waste. In Copenhagen we distribute all our ciders ourselves on an electric cargo bike with a trailer. The Why It all started in the late summer of 2015 in Nørrebroparken in Copenhagen. We were five old friends wondering why we in Denmark don’t have a culture for drinking good cider. France, England and Spain all have their own proud traditions and vinification techniques. In august that year we borrowed a press and went straight at it. We gathered apples from the gardens and parks of Copenhagen and ended up with a small production; we filled some 100 bottles in a garage next to Utterslev Mose in the northwestern part of Copenhagen. The following year we moved “the production” into a container under Bispeengbuen in Nørrebro/Frederiksberg where we made some highly explosive cider. Next stop was Grønttorvet (the old vegetable market of Copenhagen) where we produced around 3000 L of highly drinkable cider. We delivered the cider on our bikes to bars, special kiosks and restaurants around Copenhagen and when the summer of 2018 ended - we had been on sale for 5 months - we were sold out.",,12,Prosperity,,,

The What Shipping has been identified as a major pathway for introducing invasive species to new environments. The effects of the introduction of new species have in many areas of the world been devastating. In order to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another the Ballast Water Management Convention has been adopted by the The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the US Coast Guard. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to clean their ballast water to a certain standard. A number of approved ballast water management systems are available on the market, however, there are no approved systems for which can automatically test water quality according to the IMO and USCG ballast water standards. The How BallastWISE represents a new method for quantifying microbial life in relation to existing instruments used for testing ballast water. Manual microscopy using motility and fluorescence is still the benchmark against which automated systems are tested, and in many ways, BallastWISE is an automation of that procedure using software, cameras and optical assemblies. Currently, the only excepted compliance test must be performed in the laboratory and is often based on manual microscopy, which is time consuming and expensive. It is our ambition to make BallastWISE the first portable test kit which will go a long way towards a true compliance test in the field. The Why We heard about the Ballast water convention back in 2013, before it was adopted by the IMO. At that time the market for Ballast Water Management Systems (BWMS) was developing, but there was very little interest in test-systems for ballast water quality. However, we were sure that test tools eventually would be needed. We had worked with image analysis based tools and camera-technology for analysis of micro-organisms for many years, and had software tools that we found suitable for automatic testing of live organisms in water samples. We applied for funding from several Danish funds, who supported the development of Ballastwise, which was much more challenging than we initially thought it would be. The Ballastwise system is now fully functional, and is being tested by several external laboratories.",,14,Planet,,,

It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects, problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Effects on humans include disruption of various hormonal mechanisms. The How rel8 develops zero-impact traceability technology for plastics production. We focus on manipulation of surface textures in the molding step, thereby avoiding unnecessary process steps and materials.

2743,2743,Healper,http://www.healper.dk,https://plusimpact.io/startups/healper-2,"The Pitch Healper is an online booking platform that matches people with mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety and addiction with the right psychologist that fits their needs. The What In Denmark, mental disorders account for 25% of the disease burden and cost society 55 billion DKK annually with more than 2,000 people receiving therapy from a psychologist every day. Further, too many individuals do not receive timely help as they cannot cope with the draining 5-hour process it takes to find and book a psychologist. At the same time, U.S. experience shows that only 20-40% of people find a psychologist they trust and have ´chemistry´ with. This is tragic, as just one bad experience can cause a client to completely drop out of or postpone his/her therapy. The ineffective booking process and the risk of a poor patient-therapist match mean that many people continue to struggle with mental illness who could otherwise be treated. This has major consequences for individuals whose mental illness markedly impairs their quality of life, but also largely affect their family and friends. Furthermore, this is a major problem for society. The How The cornerstone of Healper is an optimal match between each client and psychologist combined with a personal tailormade user journey. The most important factor in the match is optimizing the likelihood of a strong therapeutic alliance between the psychologist and the client. The best condition for this therapeutic alliance appears when the psychologist reminds the client of someone, he/she naturally trusts. Therefore, we determine matches based on the psychologist’s experience, geography, style, and demography. We have set up an operational analysis algorithm with variable constraints that mathematically assess the matching parameters and can choose which psychologists best match each client. In the U.S., we have found that these parameters can improve the match rate by approximately 350%. Healper’s team has extensive experience in advanced mathematical models and AI, and are using a culturally adapted version of the U.S. algorithm. The Why Three years ago, when one of the founders was studying in the United States, he developed with two friends a diary app that uses artiﬁcial intelligence to improve the mental health of psychologists’ clients. He, however, he realized that the psychology market was not ready for the technology and found there were lower hanging fruits with greater value in facilitating the relationship between psychologists and clients, so he began to research the market and build the team.",,3,People,,,

We want to bring circularity into one important aspect of human life: moving in and out. Moving requires many boxes that will be only used once although their lifetime is much greater than that. Rebox has created a logistics system that allows for each box to be used to its fullest capacity, safely. The How The company's idea is to reuse moving boxes through three channels. The first is home by picking up moving boxes from customers' home, the second by collecting used boxes from stores, and the third is to wholesale boxes to moving companies as many of them, especially the smaller ones, cannot afford to stock moving boxes. Delivery and future pick-up of the boxes are both included in the price. For every ten boxes that are collected, Rebox commits to plant one tree via the ""Vi forest"". Reactions from customers are very positive, they do not have to handle the boxes themselves. So far, 40,000 moving boxes have been saved. The Why Fredrik got the idea for the company in connection with his job at the time in shipping and container freight, and his and a friend's move. He did not want to throw away his moving boxes, so his friend came and picked them up for himself. According to Fredrik, shipping and Rebox's idea is really the same business model, so in 2014 he started testing the idea as a hobby, and then started the company in 2015.",,12,Prosperity,,,

The What Traversing from East to West and experiencing industrial pollution to mass consumption, we came to an idea to reduce the environmental footprint. This through careful selection of products for the global market, starting with the bag industry. We often overlook how a product is manufactured and what kind of materials are used in our day-to-day consumption. However, our choice of purchase has huge impacts both on the environment and human health. Since the consequences of this careless consumption are more evident now than ever, it is time to scrutinize our behavior and take our responsibility towards the people and the planet. The How Because of our strong environmental focus, it’s natural to choose the absolute best environmentally friendly materials that exist on earth. Therefore, The Poli is offering bags, made of the most sustainable natural fiber jute and ecological cow leathers. High environmental standards not only depends on the materials used, it also calls for the importance of several production aspects. We want to go further than the sustainable resource use by combining a regenerative design concept together with ethical business and leadership from our manufacturing to business offer. The Why As The Poli is here to lead the way and be an example to the rest of the world our journey will never end. We will always strive to do things better by keep thinking outside the box. Our ‘zero waste policy’ is implemented in the production plan through converting wastage of materials into usable resources. Through our continuous production improvements efforts we also strive to reduce waste as well as resources such as water and energy consumption in the production process. We also hope to be able to use recycled water and renewable sources for energy in our future production plan, in order to reduce environmental impacts further.",,12,Prosperity,,,

The What Climate action. Most means of transportation have a certain ecological footprint. As carbon emissions have a direct effect on global warning and travelling is getting very popular for both leisure and business we saw an opportunity to develop a solution which will allow enterprises to meet without leaving their offices. The How We encourage companies to travel less and work in virtual reality instead. In the period of 3,5 years, we have talked with more than 500 business entities and figured out their needs in terms of meeting spaces. Consequently, we have developed 8 different environments in Virtual Reality allowing them to do collaborative work in VR. The Why 5 years ago most of the VR applications were in gaming and enttertainment sector.

The platform supports woman in building a strong network they can draw upon to advance their career. Our goal is gender equality in leadership roles and management boards – to the benefit of the individual, corporations and society at large. The What SDG 5: gender equality Despite the fact that it’s recognised more women in top management has a positive impact on the bottom line, gender equality in Danish leadership roles and management boards leaves a lot to be desired. With 27% of woman in leadership positions Denmark is the lowest ranking of the Nordic countries and even below the OECD average of 31%.1 When it comes to corporate and board management numbers are even lower. In 2018 the proportion of women in top management was 13% and board management 17% , and the trend is decreasing. For instance only one of the C25 listed companies has a female CEO. One challenge is that candidates to fill top leadership positions are recruited via network and since these are male ‘heavy’ it creates a vicious circle that takes effort to interrupt.1 Goodtalks address the network issue that prevent women from landing top management positions by offering a platform where woman can build strong alliances and get support to grow their career. The How Goodtalks offer professional women a digital platform that allows them to build and strengthen their network across roles, functions and businesses. It works as an exchange of experiences and knowledge, which given the digital format removes barriers by making help, sparring and sharing easily available. In addition the setup encourages honest exchange of both good and challenging experiences, which serve to fuel our members with needed competencies and courage to advance their career. Further members are regularly offered the opportunity to meet in person at live events where they network and listen to two inspiring speakers (e.g. CEO’s and politicians) who share the unglossy version of their career stories. The Why Spending many years in Corporate World, Pernille who established Goodtalks, would at times find herself in organisations that had a deep negative impact on her mood and wellbeing. So much so that she would bring the tension home and take it out on her family. Searching for an explanation (and solution) a pattern emerged. Business where she had struggled to thrive all had a lack of female competencies in leadership roles and management boards in common. An imbalance that affected the entire organisation. A deep desire to facilitate balanced organisation via gender equality and change this dynamic took root. Pernille identified community as a key leaver to achieve this. An environment where women can meet up online and offline to share experiences and support each others growth. She also recognised that in order for the sharing to be relatable and have a transformational impact it had to be honest and ‘unglossy’. Soon after Goodtalks was launched.",,5,People,,,

With all the cases of and the significant increase in bankruptcies, bad payers, fraud and all of the money laundering scandals, it has become a real problem not knowing whether or not to trust one another when doing business, especially for startups. All rating agencies are focus on enterprise solutions and the big-money, but the one has the most to potentially lose is Startups. They lack the financial capacity to withstand losses from a costumer going bankrupt and them taking a loss. Thats why we offer our services at a significant discount for all startups. Good Creditinformation should be for everybody. The How Using our experience with investigating financial crime and combining it with multiple structured and unstructured datasources we new patterns emerge. This allows us to generate the next level of machine learning algorithms that predict those patterns with real time data. Now we predict 65% of all bankruptcies minimum 3 month prior to the bankruptcies and 90% of our QA-fraud cases prior to credit being obtained. The Why We lost money ourselves due to bankruptcies and fraud. We tried to go to the big rating agencies, saw the price-level and was dismissed. We also saw the various money laundering scandals and wanted to do something about that. Small business should not worry about getting paid, but rather focus on selling and growing.",,8,Prosperity,,,
2768,2768,Reach Active,https://www.reachactive.co/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/reach-active-1,"The Pitch Reach has developed a 100% online physiotherapy app to help MSK pain sufferers (the #1 cause of disability globally) access quality and evidence based care and build up the active habits that are shown to most effectively treat and prevent pain. The What Pain management and prevention should be centred around a multidimensional approach - focusing on physical activity and exercise but also on building understanding of pain and the confidence in one's ability to deal with pain. Frustratingly, MSK pain is a global epidemic, and a lot of the current treatment is part of the problem, not the solution: 1. Still, too many health practitioners promote passive treatment approaches and passive coping strategies. 2. For most, the active approach that best treats pain requires active habits to be formed, which includes both belief and behaviour change. Sadly, no one offers this high-quality care in a way that supports habit change. At Reach, we build up people’s ability and confidence to self-manage, so they do not become dependent on health professionals. In everything we do, we strive to make recovery and prevention more reassuring, accessible and motivating. The How Currently patients complete a 8 minute online assessment and receive a personalised video exercise program, we then motivate and evolve their program to recovery. During your time with Reach, we’ll work with you to develop the confidence you need to stay active at your own pace, in a way that suits your lifestyle. We’ll also support you with ongoing educational material to make sure you fully understand what’s going on ‘under the bonnet’ of your pain. You’ll get access to new educational material at checkpoints throughout your road to recovery so that you can make informed choices about how best to deal with your symptoms and keep progressing. The Why This is where it all started, and what drives everyone at Reach, everyday. - We really believe in all the benefits of being active - social, stress relief, increased energy, better health and more. - And we admire all those trying their hardest to make themselves and their lives better - and I genuinely believe most people are trying their hardest in life (shout out to Brene Brown’s book on Shame and her ted talks for this learning). - There are loads of great tools and people helping you to be active and stay active, but when things go wrong and you’re held back by pain and injury, the available choices are all so frustratingly inconvenient, slow and boring. - SO, we are ‘empowering people when their active best is under threat’. And we hope that by helping people become stronger and move forward, we can help make their lives that much better, in-turn increasing their capacity to make the lives of those around them better, and bit by bit we’ll make the world that bit better.",København,3,People,,,

The What Tooler was founded in June 2016 with the intention to bring an alternative to the high consumption we have in the community, and create an experience for rent that is so good that you don't think about buying anymore. We follow three principles to make a difference for your wallet, the future of society and the environment: 1. Reduce consumption and make better use of resources 2. Reward quality and make sharing easy and cost effective 3. Allow more people to access equipment to limit social differences The How We work both as final service provider and as SaaS provider - think of us like an Amazon for renting, making it easy for companies to offer their existing rental services or build entirely new rental and sharing services that are super convenient for the customer. We offer different kinds of membership allowing you to receive a discount on quality and professional equipment from day one so you can do more activities or use the equipment over several days. The Why Tooler is building a completely new business model - a convenient platform that companies can build new business on related to renting and sharing resources. We aim to develop a service so user friendly that it outcompetes a purchase decision for the end customer. This way we contribute to reducing today’s overconsumption and improve the growing sharing and circular economy.

2771,2771,Cleaner Future,http://www.cleanerfuture.fi/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/cleaner-future,"The Pitch We combine energy efficiency, uninterrupted power and solar power generation The What The intelligent Dynamic Power System uses solar panels with diesel or gas generators to dramatically reduce the use of fossil fuels and to provide clients with comfort and the reliability of the power supply. The heart of our solution is the Dynamic Power System. It balances unsymmetrical loads, filters harmonic currents, compensates reactive power, and supplies high current peaks on demand. This greatly improves the generator efficiency by reducing the losses and preventing overheating. Our solution replaces diesel with solar energy and gives you savings every day. The How The Dynamic Power System provides excellent reliability, balancing unsymmetrical loads, filters harmonic currents, compensates reactive power, and supplies high current peaks on demand. The energy surplus can be stored in the batteries or sold to the power utility. In case of power failure in the grid, the Dynamic Power System immediately isolates our client’s system from the grid and continues an uninterrupted power supply to our client. The change of power supply from the grid to the energy storage is undetectable to the client and they continue enjoying uninterrupted power. When the generators are used as a back-up, the Dynamic Power System supplies power from solar panels and/or from the energy storage during the downtime of the generators. The Why Our business and motivation is based on our willingness to offer solutions combining three areas of sustainability; ecological, economical and technical. We realise that practically the only way to make ecologically sustainable solutions widely popular is to make them economically viable for our clients. We are happy to offer solutions where economic feasibility can be well analysed before the investment decision.

2772,2772,NurseBuddy,http://www.nursebuddy.co,https://plusimpact.io/startups/nursebuddy-1,"The Pitch NurseBuddy helps SMB home healthcare companies to provide high quality, outcome-based home care. The What The main problem we are solving is the increasing health care costs due to aging population. With high quality home care costs can be kept reasonable and older people happier in their own homes. The problem affects firstly the home care recipients who are vulnerable people. Secondly current situation creates a lot of stress to home care professionals who are trying to provide high quality care but with poor coordination. Thirdly, this affects the societies with cost pressure and the feeling that we can't take care of this generation of older people. The How We have a care coordination software for the home care managers in the office and a mobile app for the care workers in the field. Family members and other stakeholders are also welcome to collaborate for better care. Care coordination software helps the manager to build a good long-term care plan and plan weekly activities based on each individual's long term targets. It helps to find the most suitable care workers for each home visit in an efficient way, ensuring good continuity of care. Mobile app for care workers ensures that they have all the vital information with them when going to meet a person in need of support. They can feel much more confident and do their work better with no stress. Family members can also share their observations and worries - even if they are not professionals, they typically know the person from many decades and might notice changes that professionals don't. The Why We have family and friends working in different roles in home care and we heard from them how poor the existing systems are. We felt that a good solution should really help the staff to do their work better and give them peace of mind. Doing several home care visits with our pilot customers boosted our motivation to solve this complex problem.",,3,People,,,

We unleash the knowledge hidden behind the texts that many of us are overloaded with on a day to day basis. We already piloted in 4 countries and thanks to a research study we can prove that people felt more confident reading after using iSmart for a few months. The How We have our own patentable methodology that was developed together with psychologists, educationalists and experts in technology and we have ported this to an app that users can have on their mobiles or tablets. We combine various functionalities that allow users to personalise what they read and how they read it, and we also allow them to build a visual representation of what they are reading that helps the 65% of the population that are visual learners. Text to speech and speech to text technology is also available in our app and this can be slowed or speeded up by the user to find the optimum comprehension for them. The Why We had a past colleague whose son was severely dyslexic and ended up dropping out of school. This let us to start the search for a better way to learn and with collaborations with different experts and researchers we built the first basis of iSmart that we then tested out in Sweden, Turkey and the Czech Republic.

A change on the skin can be an early warning sign of Melanoma skin cancer. The What 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed is skin cancer and it's estimated that over 250 million people is in the high risk of developing or dying of Melanoma - the most dangerous form of skin cancer. 1 in 5 people in the USA will develop skin cancer during their life and in Australia, it is 2 out of 3 people that will develop skin cancer. 98,3% survive melanoma and is cured if it is caught early and the single most important thing you can do actively, is to keep an eye on your skin and look for changes - either a new mark forming on your skin or as a change in an existing mole. +70% of all melanoma incidents form as a new mark on your skin and does not develop from an existing mole. Doctors are generally very good at diagnosing and assessing skin cancer, but can often not support the patient with identifying changes on your skin. Miiskin can help you with identifying changes on your skin. The How Identifying changes on your skin, remembering all of your skin’s appearance and remember to follow up on your own skin self-examinations on a regular basis is not easy without the support of technology, and this is where the Miiskin’s platform comes in. Our app helps you structure a process around your skin examinations and allows you to take and keep photos of your skin and moles for monitoring over time. It assists you in comparing photographs over time by allowing side-by-side viewing and parallel manipulation of the images. This makes it far easier for the user to identify differences between photos such as the appearance of a new mole, or a change to an existing mole. Our new Skin Mapping feature where AI and machine learning highlights all the moles and marks on your skin so you will be able to identify new marks on your skin is the first step in the direction of automatic detection of new marks and was covered by Forbes.com, https://cutt.ly/EwF4xlW The Why Miiskin was founded by Jon, who needed a better way to track the moles on his partner Rikke’s back. The doctor recommended Jon and Rikke to take photos and save them on a computer together with some written notes by pen and paper. He couldn’t help thinking that digital machine learning and photos of the moles could simplify and improve this process. 500,000 downloads and thousands of positive messages from happy users show that this is a concern many are looking to solve.

The What We are working to prevent future alcohol abuse by challenging young people to reflect on how and when they use alcohol. We also believe that if the Nordic drinking culture is more inclusive, ie no social or peer pressure, more people will choose to participate and socialize on arenas we typically associate with lots of drinking. The How We challenge students at universities and university colleges in the Nordics to take three months sober while we give them weekly tasks to explore. They share content about their experiences with friends or other students publicly through our Nattens helter platform. We target campus by campus, starting with hiring four students part time to do the challenge while the rest of the students can watch their journey through social media. After a year we introduce an app so that the majority of the students who wish to do the challenge can do so with friends and student unions. The Why We were students once. And we know that it is easy to become a high functioning alcoholic if you are part of drinking culture that encourages high consumption. We have also seen accidents happen because of it.

2785,2785,BetterNow,http://www.betternow.org,https://plusimpact.io/startups/betternow-1,"The Pitch Our mission: to make the world more generous by helping charities to engage supporters in novel ways of giving and fundraising. The What The core of our story has always been a simple and clear mission: To make the world more generous. And enabling anyone to start a fundraiser is the first step to achieve this goal. We believe that if we can change the way fundraising is perceived, we can help more of the world’s wealth be donated to charities. We don’t aim at taking another slice of the donations going to charities, we want to increase the total amount of donations charities receive. The How BetterNow’s fundraising solution enables any charity to engage their supporters in peer-to-peer fundraising. At its core BetterNows solutions allow supporters of charities to speak up about their favourite cause and engage their network in fun and creative ways to fundraise. The solution is hosted and maintained by BetterNow but the charity can change the design so it matches their storytelling and branding. Our goal is that no donor or fundraiser will ever know who BetterNow is and that the charity receives the full attention. The Why Fundraising has histrionically been mostly related to printed campaigns, telemarketing, monthly printed newsletters and people fronting you in the street or knocking on your door with rattle cans. It has been surprisingly slow at moving online, maybe because the major part of donations traditionally comes from older generations. Now the new generations are online in many aspects of their lives, and thanks to the internet, information has crossed borders in a way society has not seen before. Peer-to-peer fundraising is growing with the wide use of social media, new generations seek self-realisation and ways to create their own identity outside of previous traditions and norms. Although peer-to-peer fundraising has been dominated by large giving platform, we learned donors want to engage with charities, not platforms. That's why we created BetterNow.",,10,Prosperity,,,
2793,2793,Drupps,http://drupps.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/drupps-1,"The Pitch Drupps turns air into clean drinking water wherever you are in the world. At any time. The What Water scarcity is building up all over the world, forcing us to think about water in new ways. We need to use less, recycle more, and find new sources. The atmosphere is such a source and Drupps is focused on bringing it to you. We envision urban areas in 2040 to be producing their own drinking water straight from the air. This will reduce limits to growth and help them find a sustainable balance with nature. Eco pressure on groundwater, rivers and lakes will be reduced, to the benefit of the entire eco system in the region. The How Drupps Concept is based on two modules – humidity absorption and evaporation – that combine together to create powerful and flexible atmospheric water generation. Our patented LiquiDes sorption technology efficiently absorbs humidity from ambient air and creates distilled and mineralized water. LiquiDes technology is leading the market hands-down in terms of best operating climate range and energy efficiency. The Why For a long time, lack of technological development prevented atmospheric water from fulfilling its potential as a major water provider for people. Common cooling of air is simply not good enough to create low-cost water outside the tropics. Drupps has developed technology for production of low-cost water from the atmosphere in climate conditions previously unreachable, including dry inland regions.

The What 100x growth is expected in battery use in the coming decades due to electric vehicle and new energy generation technologies (e.g. wind and solar) if batteries are able to overcome the four key problems of Lithium-ion batteries limiting uptake: high cost, long charging time, low energy capacity, limited scalability and flammability. BroadBit is uniquely able to overcome all these key barriers to growth. BroadBit literally enables the electrification of transportation and the uptake of intermittent energy sources to replace fossil fuels. The How BroadBit's batteries are uniquely based on sodium chloride (table salt), enabling exceptionally high power and energy, low material and manufacturing costs and safe and stable performance by avoiding the costly and dangerous failure modes of Li-ion batteries. No other commercial battery technology uses sodium chloride as the active material. Our advantages compared to Lithium-ion are: 1) 50% higher energy per cost 2) 25% higher energy per weight 3) More environmentally friendly, scalable and sustainable 4) Simpler, open air manufacturing 5) Safer (non flammable, no risk of overcharging) 6) More durable (no risk of undercharging, 2x the operating temperature range: -20 to +60C) The Why We started the company to solve the last remaining problems to the mass market update of wind and solar energy and electric vehicles: insufficient energy density, high cost, limited raw materials, and poor safety of existing batteries. After thinking and experimenting for several years, we developed our high performance, cheap, scalable and safe solution.

It is a virtual reality platform (VR) where operating teams, individually or together, can train technical skills like procedures and team-skills like cooperation. The company is now rapidly entering other areas of medical treatment training like heart stop (CPR) and Triage (to mark and select patients in war, accidents and pandemics like covid 19). Alteruna has developed a training platform using gaming technology and VR. Using it teams and individuals will be immersed in a virtual copy of their physical environment, interacting with purely digital objects or a mix of physical and digital objects. It is a long time since I had a day job. I have been an entrepreneur most of my professional life. The South General Hospital of Stockholm (Södersjukhuset) approached me and asked if we could combine VR and haptic robots. We said yes and showed them a proof of concept.

2798,2798,Aqsens Health Oy,http://www.aqsens.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/aqsens-health-oy,"The Pitch Aqsens Health has developed non-invasive and patented E-TRF method for health analysis. As a method it is accurate, quick and mobile with low costs of deployment, which makes it an ideal solution for preventive health screening. Especially for developing economies. The What Due to the continuous increase of healthcare costs we have to change the way we think and how to take preventive actions into agenda of national health issues - those actions will require new innovative healthtech and preventive funding mechanism like ""Result Based Financing"" (SIB models). AQH’s E-TRF method is highly versatile and it works with any human body liquid, saliva, urine or microbiota. Key application are Oral Cancer (India), Prostate Cancer (Finland / India / Mexico) and Preterm birth (EU project filed) but method can detect many other diseases as well. In India where we are working with the Public Health Foundation of India (www.phfi.org) and Ministry of Biotechnology to have over 100 00 saliva based oral cancer and anaemia tests done by 2020 with the target of getting our solution to be served millions in India. The How Aqsens Q-System consists of a reader, testkit (consumable) and intelligent algorithm on a tablet / laptop. With a low cost and ease of use / manage solution it can scale preventive health screening for masses. Being a non-invasive method it will not require basically any medical education nor laboratory conditions. The Why Initially I was intrigued by novelty of the innovation, core technology and key people working with it. Later when I realised healthcare challenges faced by our society, but especially in developing economies, I decided to put my full energy and competence to turn the fundamental idea to a reality. In addition eye opening visits to hospitals in Argentina (Buenos Aires), Mexico (Guadalajara) and several places (hospitals / villages) guided tours to slums) in India with NGO's (Vijayawada, Lucknow, Bangalore, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi) has further strengthen my view on how important new healthtech innovation and respective funding mechanisms are.",,3,People,,,
2803,2803,TwoDads Ltd.,https://www.twodads.fi/en,https://plusimpact.io/startups/twodads-ltd,"The Pitch Two dads fight childhood obesity together with scientists and medical doctors via wholesome food for kids The What We want to impact the global childhood obesity epidemic. The number of overweight or obese infants and young children (aged 0 to 5 years) increased from 32 million globally in 1990 to 41 million in 2016. The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30% higher than that of developed countries. If current trends continue the number of overweight or obese infants and young children globally will increase to 70 million by 2025. Consequences of obesity in childhood Obese children are more likely to develop a variety of health problems as adults. These include:cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance (often an early sign of impending diabetes), musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis - a highly disabling degenerative disease of the joints), some cancers (endometrial, breast and colon), disability. The How We make wholesome food for kids – naturally. Our products are made to decrease kid's daily excess calorie intake and increase daily dietary fibre intake. We make juices, smoothies and breakfast cereals that are low in sugar and high in fibre without any artificial sweeteners and other unnecessary additives. All products are developed together with medical doctors in Finland and also Helsinki university scientists (who are experts in food technology and nutrition). We take a holistic approach and want also to empower parents and motivate kids to do more physical activity, sleep better and spend more time with people instead of screens. The Why We had our own ad agency focused on FMCG brands. We worked with many international and domestic brands e.g. Coca Cola, Nestle, Unilever, Snickers, Mountain Dew, etc.. After we had kids, we realized we would do anything so that they would have the best possible start in life. We soon realized that there were few healthy foods available for kids and we could not find any companies that put kids wellbeing first. So we contacted scientists Helsinki",,3,People,,,

It does so by developing an electronic shopping list using voice recognition and photos, with the option of purchasing cooking videos made with this particular target audience in mind. The What SDG - 10.2: In 2030, social, economic and political inclusion of all strengthened and promoted, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status. Our app helps people with special disabilities and in the social field so they can become more independent in their daily lives. As a side effect, being able to cook after video recipes will contribute to increased health of the individual user. The How Many in the target group are not able to write / read their own shopping list or follow a food recipe. They can use intuitive tools (such as tablets and smartphones). We will take advantage of this and thereby help them become more independent, gain greater confidence and feel more free. They want to feel like others who do not have a disability. The app will help target group so they can create an electronic shopping list, using only voice recognition and photos, and make easy dishes for video recipes, without being able to read and write. The Why One of our team members (Birgitte) who is a specialized teacher, has developed and tested the idea of approx. 20 students, who eg are diagnosed autists. They find it difficult to make their own shopping list and follow cooking videos. She used physical pictograms and homemade videos. Her students use them today. She told about the idea for (Ninna and Nilofar), who suggested developing an app. We made a few calculations and saw the potential business, not only in Denmark, but every where in the World. (1 % of the population are diagnosed autists, 7-10 % are having severe reading and writing difficulties, 200.000 persons (in Denmark) suffer for brain damages from eg traffic accidents. Revenue generation in the app: Video part: (purchase in the app) Our test result shows that 82% of the target group in DK want to buy the video part => 311,600 people. We expect ¼ of these => 77,900 persons => DKK 15,502,100 Purchase list: Add ons: (311.600 people) RPM formula. A year in DK: DKK 22,219,302.",,10,Prosperity,,,
2808,2808,Swancy,https://swancyapp.com/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/swancy,"The Pitch Swancy is a platform for swapping clothes where people can give their preloved, but no longer used items a new home while getting something they fancy in return. The What We believe the throwaway culture that has emerged undermines the real value of fashion. Our closets are full of items we don't wear. Creating new clothes is a costly process both in terms of the environmental cost of producing fabric material, and in terms of labour cost of production. At the same time, fashion is meant to be enjoyed. We need to think differently and be smarter in the way we consume clothes, particularly in developed countries where abundance is becoming an environmental challenge. Through Swancy we promote sustainability through reuse and give people a chance to make use of the resources they have. The How Swapping is a win-win situation and one of the most sustainable and economical ways to enjoy fashion. Our aim is therefore to make swapping available for everyone at all times. We wish to inspire people to invest in quality rather than quantity. Sustainable and ethically produced products tend to be more expensive. Swancy provides a way for people to focus on quality while still having the freedom to experiment with their style. The Why We personally love swapping and find that both receiving and giving away preloved items sparks a lot of joy. Swancy's founder was inspired by the Nordic Swap Day, organised in Norway by Naturvernforbundet. She wanted to create a swap-option that was available throughout the year. When we started doing our market research the depth of the environmental and ethical challenges facing the fashion world were quickly revealed. We felt there was a need for a revolution in the way we consume, enjoy and think about fashion.",,12,Prosperity,,,

The What Global warming has become a major concern for the entire world. In the last few decades, environmental impact of the petrol run vehicles, along with the rising oil prices, has led to a massive interest in electric transportation among the people. The world that we live in, is now counting record-high CO2 levels every minute. And, that’s resulting in the rising temperature. Conventional combustion vehicles produce toxic gases that are affecting the health of more than a million people every year. The How EQUAON is a mobility sharing company with the aim to provide effortless hardware and software solutions for smart cities / mobility operators. The company initiated its operations in Helsinki, Finland with the team of part-time core team members. We have developed high-quality electric scooters that will push the world’s transition to the green sustainable transportation. The Why Our journey started from a dream to make some small good things happen in this world today, so that we could abundantly rejoice in it tomorrow. We welcome every day with a continuous motion and willingness to improve, and to try new directions. That is why we strived to create vehicles that could make our motion a happy one, and prompt ecological thinking. One of our key goals since the very start was to stimulate people to rely on ecological means of transport. This is very important for our future!",,11,Prosperity,,,
2817,2817,Healstack,http://www.healstack.com,https://plusimpact.io/startups/healstack,"The Pitch Healstack is AI-powered health app helping women overcome disordered eating and obesity. The What There is 1.9 billion people in the world who are overweight. Currently available tools are not working, especially fad diets. Therefore, we are challenging the diet industry and the global obesity epidemic by introducing a new way to manage weight. Our vision is to get 1 million women to stop fad dieting forever and instead embrace a balanced lifestyle by managing their habits and hunger cues instead of obsessing over food elimination and calorie counting. Women are heavily targeted by the diet industry, keeping them in the loop of not only unhealthy eating behaviors but low self-esteem. In its core, Healstack is tailored for people who struggle with disordered eating patterns and have previously failed to lose weight using conventional methods. Even though we focus on women at this stage, it is ideal for anyone who wants to re-balance their relationship with food, cheaper, easier and with long-term sustainability. The How To achieve our goal, we are introducing HungerQ - a hunger algorithm that helps stabilize and improve hunger cues for those who are unable to “hear their body” properly, due to years of dieting, disordered eating, and food restriction. We draw our learnings from eating disorder recovery research and root our principles in overcoming conditions like Binge Eating Disorder. In addition, with AI we are benchmarking healthy and unhealthy behaviors to recognize disordered patterns early on and apply recommendations that will help empower the individual to create new coping skills instead of food. The Why We built Healstack because we have recognized the need for people (especially women) to receive help with their disordered eating. Currently, in many countries the medical help is expensive, doctors are not familiar with disorders like BED and there is a deep-rooted stigma as well as fat-phobia. This idea was a way of finding a solution after one of our founders wasn't able to get help. Through research & tech exploration we found a combination that works which we tested with users. It helped our research participants. Once we saw the huge change it made, it was a no-brainer to keep up.",,3,People,,,
2822,2822,Provement,http://www.provement.io/,https://plusimpact.io/startups/provement-1,"The Pitch A solution for data driven childhood obesity treatment. Families with obese children collect data at home with a smartphone application and connected devices. We analyze data to facilitate more effective and efficient treatment. Effect has been verified in a RCT and clinical practice. The What Childhood obesity has many negative effects including: reduced academic performance, lower expected income, increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and overall reduced quality of life. The risks are normalized by successful weight loss. There is immense potential for personal and societal cost savings even if the individuals regain weight and become obese again as adults. Today the global prevalence of childhood obesity is around 5 % and much higher in most parts of the developed world. In the EU only about 10 % of obese children receive treatment. The How Provement is a software platform that connects families with obese children to treatment clinics. Patients/families collect data in their own home with a smartphone application and connected devices. The data is analyzed to set targets and give some feedback directly to the patients/families but our USP is that we give health care professionals better tools that allow them to treat more patients with better results given the same resources. We give clinics a tool to provide effective and cost efficient childhood obesity treatment. The Why We have people in our team who has worked with childhood obesity for a long time and understand the need for better tools to give to the health care professionals that work with the disease. We are close to the problem and realize how big impact we can have. The effects of successful weight loss are not only noticeable short term, but affects the entire life of the people we manage to help.",,3,People,,,

Every match is a date within 7 days. The What 3. Good Health and Well-Being Such mental disorders as depression can lead to suicide. Nearly 800,000 suicides occurred worldwide in 2015, with men about twice as likely to commit suicide as women. One of our biggest health issues is loneliness and its proven that people are more happy if they are in a relationship or have strong relationships around them. The How Many people want to find someone, but the landscape of finding someone isn't easy, especially as there is not easy to find someone when all the dating apps and services are built with gamification so that you get hooked but not find anyone. YouViaMe is not only the most safest dating app on the market, it's also fully focused on making people meet in real life. Users can't chat in the app, every match, facilitated by a friend that they trust and know, becomes a date within 7 days at our partners venue. The Why I became single and downloaded all the different dating apps on the market and realised rather quickly that none of the apps actually want you to find someone. Let's use Tinder for example, all users have a tinder score and you can only get matched with people within your score, if you swipe yes on to many, then they will only show you everyone who said no etc. I was tired of the way they we're built and just wanted to change it and help people meet. In YouViaMe, when a single user finds someone, they just become matchmaker for their single friends, more ""pay it forward"" thought than just locking people in to the app and not allowing them to find love.",,3,People,,,

We make therapeutic techniques more accessible. Mindfit is suitable for all kinds of people in difficult situations or who are in a period of their lives where they feel stressed, worried, anxious, need motivation or are depressed and lack energy. The tool is inspired by well-recognized treatments such as cognitive therapy, positive psychology and EMDR, but also by the more general communication and therapy techniques used in psychology. The How It’s easy to get stuck in negative thoughts and feelings about yourself when you go trough a tough time like stress, lack of energy and motivation or depression. With simple steps and techniques Mindfit teaches users to shift their focus away from negative thought patterns and low self-esteem, to a greater sense of mastery and positive thoughts about themselves.

Mindfit helps users to set goals, focus on and achieve them. This goal setting process helps the user to refocus the negative energy into a constructive and positive experience raising self-esteem and reinforcing positive thoughts. Change takes time and usually consists of both progress and setbacks. Mindfit helps you see that you are on the right track! The Why We want to help others – shift focus, set limits and get a greater sense of empowerment with respect to the challenges we all face in our everyday lives.

2840,2840,mfore,http://www.mfore.fi,https://plusimpact.io/startups/mfore-1,"The Pitch engaging patient for better health outcome in thier treatment pathway The What Healthcare providers are faced with the challenge of low care plan adherence by patients, inefficient administration, poor population reach and low patient retention rates. Moreover, it is considered that healthcare provider takes responsibility of the patients’ treatment, which is quite challenging because of the ever-growing gap between doctor-patient ratio. Disconnect between healthcare provider and patient’s in-between encounters during patient pathway causing poor care outcome and wasted care. Our offering helps providers to be in continuous dialog with patients even beyond the care setting to improve care outcome, reduce care cost, enhance care experience and strengthen patient relationship. The How mfore provides the technology platform and service for healthcare providers, to utilize mobile communication channels to have a continuous dialogue with patients and care givers (e.g. family members) outside the care setting and between encounters. Our offering enables healthcare providers to converse with patients and care givers with relevant information at right times to educate, remind and reinforce the prescribed care and get insights to patient’s progress in the care process. mfore’s Patient Engagement Service (PES) provides simple to use mobile communication services to enable monitoring, adherence, counselling for healthcare providers and their patients. Patient Engagement Solution - “Simple and Functional” whether you are a patient, a doctor or a surgeon. Our solutions are simple to use but incredibly functional. Making excellent patient engagement accessible, available and affordable by design. The Why Personal and family experience of disconnect with healthcare provider during the treatment when not at healthcare location. The need for engaging patient is even more, considering the ever increasing patient numbers and needs as well lower healthcare literacy rate among general population. Especially when most of the time patients are looking for the answers to following questions when they are outside of hospital settings: • What is my main problem? • What do I need to do? • Why is it important for me to do this? Hence the role of Doctors and healthcare professionals becomes more challenging, as they need to educate the patient as well. But then the shortage of time on healthcare professionals, a patient does not get satisfying or meaningful answers. That leads to poor or low treatment adherence. This is where the solution like ours come as conduit between patients and doctors that enables the continuous communication (two-way), resulting in better healthcare outcomes.",,3,People,,,

We help make it simple for people to take their old device and #PassItOn The What At Lokalist, we are building a platform that aims to raise awareness of just how unsustainable the smartphone production industry actually is. We find solutions to reduce the number of phones being produced, use the ones we have already made to their full potential, and recycle those that are no longer useful. We believe one of the key drivers of change is knowledge. Once you realize the average smartphone takes over half of the elements from the periodic table to produce. Elements that are toxic, dangerous to mine, and end up irresponsibly disposed of in our landfills after use. Once you know 80% of children in a small town in China have developed lead poisoning because of the high amounts of toxic metals leaking from e-waste into their drinking water, or you hear the stories of Chilean miners being paid less than $2 a day to extract the raw material that makes your screen 15% brighter...well you begin to want to make a difference.

Our real-time workflow solutions are powered by a deep learning-based AI backbone that provide fully automated image analysis, initially of MRI brain scans. The What For hospitals and clinics who cannot keep up with demand for medical image diagnostics, Cerebriu Apollo is a software solution that improves productivity and quality. Hospitals and clinics that perform medical imaging diagnostics examinations are across the globe struggling to keep up with an ever increasing demand on radiology while maintaining a high level of quality in diagnostics Up to 60% of time is spent looking at healthy images Up to 30% of patients have no clinically relevant findings Up to 15% patients are recalled for further scanning Up to 15% time spent determining the medical protocol Mean time to report is often not better for critical patients than for healthy patients Patients may be applied contrast unnecessarily, especially by younger doctors The How Cerebriu Apollo aims at addressing different pain-points in the radiological workflow: Smart Protocol: Enable to automate brain MRI protocol sequences during scanning with minimal manual intervention. Cerebriu’s smart protocol will provide a real-time classification of critical candidate pathologies from which specialized protocols may be selected. Image Reporter: Enable automatic navigation to findings in the scan both in real-time (during scanning), and during image interpretation/reporting. Triage Advisor: As a biproduct of smart protocol, the radiologist will be able to prioritize report generation of patients based on the severity of the underlying pathology. Unlike competitors focusing on diagnostics during radiologist image reading or generating more data through magic sequences during scanning, we focus on simple workflow efficiency gains automating tasks that disturb radiologists, while improving the attention to the clinically relevant findings. The Why Over the past couple of decades, the growth of the global middle class in conjunction with the growth in use of medical imaging has been stretching radiology to the brink of collapse. Teleradiology centers in low-cost countries has augmented radiologists in developed countries, to allow developed countries continued access at a tolerable level of quality, but at the sacrifice of most of the world’s population. Over the next decade the demanding middle-class will grow from nearly 3 billion to 5 billion people. Radiologists are amongst the most stressed out and sick-leave stricken population of medical doctors. Much of their work is very repetitive and the workload is ever increasing. In developed countries radiologists report on 10-15 patients per day at an approx. 4% error rate, while in developing countries this production can supersede 50 patients per day with undisclosed error rates. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/medical-imaging-what-all-fuss-robert-lauritzen/",,3,People,,,

We are solving issues within electric car-charging in real estate environment. We have over 20 years of experience in electric vehicles charging growing from the original grassroots tech movement. We combine this with deep algorithms, so that we can offer the most sophisticated local grid load balance based in real user experience. We offer the whole value chain as a one integrated service, resulting in reliability, affordability and seamless user experience. All the while, tackling one of the most pressing challenges of modern times: clean and sustainable energy. The What Be cool and keep the planet cool as well. The How The electric vehicle revolution is on its way to hit the streets. Every major car manufacturer is now bringing mid-priced electric vehicles for mass markets. Some have even announced to end the production of gasoline cars. States in wide spectrum have decided to ban all new fossil fuel cars. As the prices go down, the adoption of electric vehicles can be as disruptive as the as for the smart phone outdating the older cell phone. Only one problem has remained: How to charge the car in real estate environment. The current method of installing single chargers here and there is expensive and cumbersome. Each new set of chargers implies a new project with electrical engineering, acquisition of chargers and electrical contracting. The limits of electrical distribution center can suddenly form a barrier for adding new chargers. These difficulties have prompted the experts to forecast that the problem of charging in real estate will substantially slow down the adoption of electric vehicles. That has been the case, until now. Parking Energy Platform solves all the issues with a single stroke. The crucial distinction is to separate the cabling from the chargers. In the heart of the solution is a quick connector: In a garage, the cabling can be brought to each slot, ending to a robust and inexpensive connector. When the tenant buys an electric vehicle, the charger can be ordered to the parking slot for the next day. The installment of a charger with fitting quick connector is plug-and-play. It takes only a minute and requires no electrical planning or composing official electrical installment records. The benefit for the real estate owner is twofold. First, a large parking area can be prepared to be EV-ready with a single investment. Second, the real estate is freed from managing the installment projects, maintenance and metering the electricity. The cost of the cabling is less than 1% of the cost of a parking slot, but can add value many times over.

Such language makes these job ads biased towards specific demographic groups, discouraging other groups from applying and this effect can reduce the applicant pool by as much as 50%.

It all started in 2016 when they participated in a student challenge to solve problems in relation to the SDGs. One of the team members at that time had a cousin who was born without both her upper limbs and her parents couldn’t afford to buy her prosthetics until she reaches the age of 20 and her morphology stops growing. They made a mechanical prosthetic device at that time but we, unfortunately, didn’t agree to continue.

Mohammed, the founder of Cure Bionic, decided to take it as his graduation project in 2017 instead of a paid internship in Canada and I used his family’s financial resources to rebuild a bionic arm from scratch. It took him 8 months where he met many people with limb differences and started having them as friends. He was visiting a hospital in Tunisia where they take care of children with amputation and met an 8-year child who was electrified and lost both his right hand and leg, he was in pain, and his mum was so in a very bad situation since they cannot afford to buy a prosthetic hand for him. That day, Mohammed took a decision to address children with amputation who did not have access to these devices because they are not made small enough, because their parents cannot afford to supply them with it since it is so expensive or because existing prosthetics will not reflect their personality and preferences to make them feel proud of having such devices. He took the decision to give them more than a device, but a way to inspire the world with their positive differences.",,3,People,,,

BirdShades's Story
The story of BirdShades started with a freezer full of dead birds. A biology professor at their University collected them on the campus for further identification. The cause of death was clear: Bird strikes. The glass area was small but hundreds of birds crashed against it. They asked themselves how many birds would collide in the entire city? – and they knew we had to do something against this preventable and unnecessary death of so many birds. So, the idea for BirdShades was born.
Since then, their research has shown that billions of birds die worldwide. Some countries and cities have already implemented laws or guidelines to stop bird-window collisions such as Canada and in the US the city of New York. They found out that the bird stickers on windows don’t work, but why? Birds can see the stickers but try to fly past them because they do not perceive the glass panes as obstacles. The only thing that can help is a close-spaced pattern like dots or stripes. Of course, nobody wants to have something like this on their windows. That is why they have set themselves the goal of finding an invisible solution for people. Birds are also able to see wavelengths in the UV range. They work together with scientists from various universities to develop a window film that makes a coating with UV reflective paint invisible to people and visible to birds to protect them.
