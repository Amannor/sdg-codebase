AgRobics technology consists of polymeric modification of the immobilized cells using low-cost additives and materials. These additives significantly increase the stability, surface area, and capacity for a high density of cells, strengthening physical protection for the microorganisms.

The quantity of additives and the shape and size of the immobilized cells allow for highly effective biocatalyses to be used for biodegradation of toxic phenolic compounds and other refractory contents.
