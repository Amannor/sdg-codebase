https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/raziel-therapeutics,Raziel Therapeutics,"Raziel Therapeutics is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing a proprietary drug for targeted fat reduction. The company has developed a new chemical entity that converts white adipose tissue (WAT) into brown adipose tissue (BAT) after a single injection into subcutaneous fat, potentially providing a new way to treat people who are overweight or obese.
Raziel's primary drug candidate is RZL-012, an injectable drug that is currently in preclinical development. RZL-012 is administered by several injections delivered in a single injection session. Once injected, RZL-012 triggers immediate fat cell death, followed by a transient inflammatory process that lasts about a month during which necrotic fat tissue is replaced by fibrotic tissue. This results in a significant long-term, sustained shrinkage of fat tissue.
The company's products are based on work by the team led by Professor Muli Ben-Sasson, who discovered a family of compounds that are able to influence the fate of fat-tissue cells (adipocytes) and convert them from WAT to BAT tissues.
In November 2019, Raziel received FDA approval to develop RZL-012 as an orphan drug for Dercum's disease.
Raziel is a spin-off company of Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/poold-diagnostics,Poold Diagnostics,"Poold Diagnostics is developing a high-throughput diagnostic testing method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic screens. The company’s pooled testing method allows diagnostic laboratories to increase their testing capacity by up to a factor of 20x using their existing diagnostic testing setup. The novel method identifies all positive subjects within a large set of samples using a single round of testing, thereby reducing test costs while increasing testing capacity.
The company’s pooling-based efficient SARS-CoV-2 testing (P-BEST) method uses PCR together with a combinatorial pooling algorithm based on the mathematical theory of compressed sensing. The method, which was recently approved for clinical use by the Israeli Ministry of Health, has been used to screen over 5,000 subjects using only 700 pools and has correctly detected more than 60 positive carriers with no false negatives.
P-BEST was developed by a group of researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev and The Open University of Israel. A study describing P-BEST was simultaneously published in August 2020 in the journal Science Advances and featured in a New York Times article. The method was also covered by Scientific American, Haaretz, the BBC, and other outlets.
Poold Diagnostics was formed to bring to market a software solution that will allow implementing P-BEST in diagnostic labs around the world. The method requires the use of a liquid dispensing robot for pooling samples. The software controls the robot and guides the lab technician in the pooling process. P-BEST provides an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for increasing testing capacity that can be easily integrated into diagnostic laboratories. P-BEST will also be beneficial in diagnostic applications other than SARS-CoV-2.

The company's technology inhibits fish reproduction, channeling their energy into growth and shortening the time needed to reach market weight. The technology provides a non-GMO, non-hormonal solution for enhancing fish growth. Already tested on tilapia, the technology may also be applicable to most or all fin fish.
AquiNovo's proprietary materials are designed to be incorporated into the feed sold to fish farms and given to fish as early as possible before or during the onset of puberty. Fish growers benefit from shortened time to market, reduced overall production costs and risks associated with the growth period (e.g. disease and weather catastrophes), and more efficient use of farm resources.
AquiNovo operates within the framework of Trendlines Agtech Incubator, part of The Trendlines Group.

https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/company_page/votis-subdermal-imaging-technologies,VOTIS Subdermal Imaging Technologies,"VOTIS Subdermal Imaging Technologies is developing a system that enables doctors to assess the patency of the foot in people with peripheral artery disease. The device is intended for use during revascularization procedures to enable the doctor to understand the blood flow and oxygenation of the patient’s foot in real time.
The device is also designed for monitoring the condition of the patient’s foot during the weeks and months following the procedure, when necrotic tissue, deep wounds, infection, and ischemia can create deteriorated conditions in the foot that often require repeat revascularization procedures or amputation.
The VOTIS system utilizes multifrequency photodiodes to direct near-infrared light into the foot. By measuring the scattering and absorption of the light, VOTIS calculates oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and total oxygen saturation.
The VOTIS system generates objective and reproducible data, and the device does not need to be adjusted during the procedure after being attached to the foot. As a result, it could be a useful component of a robotic-assisted surgical system performing minimally invasive surgery on the lower limbs.

TourEngine has a patented opposed-cylinder split-cycle combustion engine with the potential for substantial efficiency gain as a result of its improved thermal management. It also offers significant reduction in noxious emissions. Unlike hybrid and electric engine technologies that offer improved efficiency but are expensive and complex, TourEngine is simple, as it is based solely on current cylinder/piston technology.
The TourEngine splits the conventional four-stroke cycle between two opposing cylinders: a cold cylinder that hosts the intake and compression strokes, and a hot cylinder that hosts the combustion and exhaust strokes. Splitting the cycle allows flexibility in the design and thermal management, consequently leading to improved energy utilization. The direct coupling of the two cylinders, a fundamental deviation from previously proposed split-cycle designs, minimizes the potential losses from splitting the cycle.

MercyBeam introduces a lens that collects most of the X-rays emanating divergently out of any standard X-ray tube and converges them toward the tumor’s location. The lens simultaneously removes low-energy photons that would be absorbed by the patient’s skin.
The convergence increases the therapeutic dose delivered at the tumor location, while the organs in the vicinity of the tumor receive a very low dose or none at all. The converging technology enables the use of photon-energy X-rays 100 times lower than those used by current systems based on linear accelerators.
