,http://blog.milaap.org/,Rainmaking,1,"Overview
Crowdfunding can be a quick and easy way to meet unanticipated, pressing needs. Today, anyone with a smartphone can participate in making a difference with great ease. More and more people are now raising funds online to tackle emergencies more efficiently. Increasing digital access and the convenience of online payments are driving more and more Indians to take the digital route to mobilize greater support for urgent needs on time.

India’s private healthcare spending is estimated at $90 billion a year. Of this, about $60 billion is out-of-pocket: from savings, borrowings and support from friends and family. This is where crowdfunding plays a role, bridging the gap, and making it easy to both ask for and render financial assistance.

People have always turned to their friends, family and communities at a time when a significant amount of money is required to deal with urgent medical crises.
About us
Milaap is an online crowdfunding platform that enables anyone across India to raise funds for healthcare, education, sports, disaster relief and other personal causes, with great ease. Founded in 2010 by a team of young and passionate entrepreneurs, Milaap has pioneered the development of person to person giving in India.

What started as a platform to fund rural projects and micro entrepreneurs, is today widely utilized by Indians to raise funds from friends, family and a wider social network for medical needs, loved ones and charity. Milaap is soon becoming the go-to platform for funding cancer treatment, transplants and other critical emergencies.

What we do
Milaap addresses the many challenges of giving (such as difficulty in discovering the right causes, trust deficit, and overall donor apathy). They share stories of (pre-qualified) individuals and groups with a network of its trusted community and partners, who either specialize in providing and managing microloans to their local communities or can connect with the cause to help with a donation.

As of August 2019, the platform has raised nearly INR 700 Cr to support 100,000 causes, impacting millions of lives across the country. Currently, donations for medical emergencies form an overwhelming majority. The platform, a majorly utilitarian one is constantly striving to take the concept of online fundraising to more and more Indians. Backed by the increasing penetration of social media and the popularization of digital payments, Milaap has quickly become India’s most preferred platform to raise funds for personal causes.",,

,http://eko.co.in/,Rainmaking,1,"About Us
Back in 2006, two brothers, while working for a telecom startup, 6D Technologies sat together at the end of a frustrating day with their bankers and wondered - why do bank work just 6 hours a day for the public when telecom companies work 24x7, without any downtime. They mused on how banking services could be brought to consumers 24x7, via a network of Business Correspondents.

Thus began the journey of Eko. Abhinav and Abhishek believed in the power of taking banking services to vast majority in real time, so much that they set in motion an exit from 6D and developed solutions for Eko. What followed was a string of inventions, patented all over the world, partnerships with the largest banks in India, and setting up of a vast chain of merchant outlets to work as Business Correspondents to provide banking services to customers, specially form weaker economic sections of the society.

Eko leveraged every progressive technology available to build solutions. From telecom based USSD to web based process and finally app based platform.

True to its mission of taking banking and financial services to all, Eko has built over 100 services on its platform to cater to all needs a customer has from a bank, and even offered open APIs to truly democratise them.

Result. Eko has served over 50 Million customers till date, is available over a merchant network of 1,50,000 customers and enables over 7 Million banking transactions a month. This it does, via its own network and by providing APIs to over 300 partners who have built their own business on top of the Eko platform.

Eko is committed to ever expanding its range of financial services with its mission to take digital economy solutions to the next 500 Million Indians and across developing markets around the world.

As a truly inclusive organisation, Eko constantly seeks partnerships to leverage its APIs and its network. And keeping true to the vision of Prime Minister Modi - 'say yes to digital payments, no to cash”, Eko welcomes merchants, developers, brands and service providers to come join hands with us and help us take Digital India to Bharat.",,

On the other hand, financial institutions have been unable to adequately serve these clients because, in this population, placing small loans can quickly become an operational nightmare .

QEIP LLC - Domain Name Consulting & Brokerage
Domain Industry
Domain names are digital assets that offer opportunities for people around the world in our modern day economy. A domain name (also called a URL) is the foundation of an Internet business. Domains have certain properties in search engines, like Google, to make them necessary for any company needing to expand their online presence, traffic, or keyword ranking. Due to the natural scarcity of them in addition to the increase in corporate demand for them, domain names are unique alternative investments for individuals looking to diversify their holdings. Whether you are looking to rebrand your online business, diverse your investments, or liquify your digital assets, qeip has people & access to meet your need.

History
Our team has recently been formed in 2016 as a response to some of the inefficient intermediaries in the current domain market. The people on our team have strong backgrounds in market research, investing, sales, and finance. Our firm picked digital assets (eg. domains & websites) as our focus because they have huge margins of growth, are easily transferable, and they are investments that we can feel good about as they help to support millions of entrepreneurs world wide. QEIP was started as a one man shack with Neil hustling from his couch in Cincinnati's east end. Now it has grown to be a world-wide team with lease & purchase agreements drafted in over 30 countries.

Our Outlook
QE Investment Planners is not just an acronym for qeip but it is a team of techy deal makers that connect intrapreneurs, entrepreneurs, & investors to the right domain name.

Get In Touch
We at qeip know it can be intimidating and difficult process to get to know the internet investing space. So, please reach out to us to discuss a potential investment in domains, a digit asset brokerage, or just throw a few questions our way!

From the land of the cleanest air in the world*
We at Air0 are truly passionate about air purification. We come from Finland, the country with the cleanest air in the world*, and we think everyone should have the luxury of breathing clean air.

Having the luxury to breathe the cleanest air in the world did not come to us out of thin air. We too, used to have severe air quality problem back in the 70’s. At that time, the Finnish government decided to react on the matter and set up two research groups dedicated to particle research. Long story short, as a result Finland breathes the cleanest air, but also leads the world in the particle research.

Our story is closely linked to the story of our country, as our CTO and co-founder Mr. Markku Rajala was one of the professionals taking part of these national particle research programs. Now, together with the rest of the highly skilled Air0 professionals, we are on a mission to enable the whole world to breathe the cleanest air.

Decades of knowledge harnessed to fight the single greatest health risk of our time.
Before Air0, Mr. Rajala was involved in the indoor air industry in the Asian market. While spending time there, it became obvious that there was a serious air quality problem and people were desperately searching for a solution. They wanted an air purifier that would really work, one that would actually clean the whole room. They needed air purifier that was capable of producing large amounts of pure air, while being silent and requiring little maintenance. They needed a new innovation for the air purification.

The problem, however, goes way beyond Asia. According to WHO, each year millions of people die as a result of being exposed to bad air quality. 9 out of 10 people in the world breathe polluted air**. Besides deaths, polluted air affects directly to health and wellbeing, and causes significant health effects. According to WHO, household air pollution is the world’s single greatest environmental health risk.

Introducing smAIRt® – the luxury of clean air
Air0 was founded in 2013. Think “Air Zero” as in “zero particles for your lungs” or “zero pollutants in the air”, which ever you prefer. The point is, it really does the job.

After extensive research & development, based on decades of knowledge and experience, we have perfected the smAIRt® technology. It combines the best of the traditional air purification technologies, mechanical and electrical filtration, and does it in a unique and smart way. Brought to you in a sleek package, designed to the finest details, it’s an air purifier that does not have to be hidden. Most importantly, it achieves what it was designed for; delivering the purest possible indoor air for the whole room.",,

Metrix: A Play On The Word Metrics, Which Is A System, Or Standard Of Measurement.
Endometrix's starting point is a Design Thinking course during the Fall 2017 semester. It was there that our founders met, became fast friends, then decided to use their unique, yet harmonious skills to initially found an innovation consultancy firm for healthcare using the Design Thinking approach.
What began as a slight awareness of endometriosis quickly turned into an obsession through Google searches, literature reviews, and, eventually, face-to-face interviews.

Ultimately, our drive to speak face-to-face with the endo community and gather the more than 700 individual experiences that helped found our app stemmed from our main goal: to help people on a larger scale while addressing their individual needs. We knew that we had to find a way to help validate the care needs of people living with endometriosis by providing adequate, accessible, and individualized care options. But how?

At the time, our final destination was unclear. However, after listening to numerous traumatic stories during these interviews, we knew that we needed to create an innovative solution to help ease the physical and emotional tolls caused by inadequate care. From this foundational groundwork, the Endometrix app was born.

Solving global diabetes challenge through innovation

The world is experiencing a diabetes epidemy! There are over 420 million diabetics in the world. At least another 400 millions are at the danger zone (pre-diabetes). According to WHO, by 2030, 18% of the world’s population will have diabetes. Diabetes has become the 7th most life-threatening disease after heart-disease and cancer. Currently, diabetes costs the society around world $847 billions yearly and has thus become one of the biggest health challenges in the modern time. 90% of the diabetics are type 2 diabetes (TDM).

Diabetes care has traditionally been focused on treatment when people already are sick. It is too late and too expensive to treat once the conditions have developed into a disease. We must start with prevention! In order to do that, we need to provide people with powerful solutions that are effective, easy to comply and affordable.

The problem with the current available solutions for diabetes prevention such as medicines and other methods have drawbacks. Medicines have side effects. Other methods such as life-style changes and exercise have low patient compliance. The consequence of these is uncontrollable diabetes 2 occurrence and  diabetes complications such as heart disease, kidney disease, blindness and amputation due to badly controlled blood sugar. These diseases cost the societies billions of dollars and enormous suffering at the patients.

Lion Healthcare has discovered a technology and know-how on to solve this challenge. Using a proprietary bioactive fish peptides composition, we target on blood glucose- and energy metabolism in the body and help people in the dangerous zone to develop diabetes 2 to prevent the disease. In addition, our solution can be supplementary to the medical treatment scheme for diabetes 2 patients to help keep their blood sugar level under better control.

MedTrace Pharma A/S was founded with the belief that we can improve diagnostic accuracy in PET perfusion examinations to the benefit of patients globally. It is our ambition to make 15O-water PET clinically available for all cardiac patients and to help usher in a new era in diagnostic medicine.

Pathway to market
MedTrace is currently preparing for a confirmatory multi-center pivotal Phase III trial in cardiology evaluating 15O-water PET versus invasive coronary angiography and current best practice SPECT imaging. The trial will be conducted under an IND with FDA supervision and includes patients from EU, North America and Japan.

Core values
01
ACCURACY
Diagnostic medicine must be accurate to guide treatment for the patient (personalized medicine). By making 15O-water clinically available we contribute to raising the accuracy.
02
SAFETY
Safety is paramount in healthcare. MedTrace believes that 15O-water PET will be proven as a safe alternative to other imaging techniques, and that the low radiation burden of 15O-water will be beneficial to the common health of the population.

03
EFFICIENCY
With an aging population, healthcare efficiency is more important than ever. By shortening the overall procedure time for patients and staff as well as raising the accuracy, MedTrace intends to raise healthcare efficiency.",,

In the last 50 years, the use of UV-tanning beds and unhealthy tanning behaviour have caused a steep increase in skin cancer rates.
According to the latest stats an estimated 232,000 people globally get melanoma every year (GLOBOCAN, 2012 stats). Melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer and currently 1.2 m Americans live with a melanoma diagnosis. The US accounts for about one third of global melanoma cases.
A personal history or a family history of melanoma increases the risk of getting a melanoma and so puts many more at risk. And the problem won’t go away, melanoma rates still continue to rise in many countries.
Luckily, there are things that can be done to remedy this challenge as survival rates increase greatly if a melanoma is caught early. So naturally, early detection of melanoma is addressed in many ways. And technology is at the center of these efforts.
Some research has shown promising results in risk assessing moles and marks for melanoma through artificial intelligence or telemedicine using clinical high resolution images. And, as technology like this will be part of the future, we do monitor the progress closely.
The journey to innovate how a melanoma is found and diagnosed is, however, filled with many technical, economical, behavioural, regulative, practical and ethical challenges. A prudent approach is warranted.
And so it is still recommended to go to a physical location to get your skin checked for melanoma and other skin cancers. And simply removing moles is not the answer either. In adults, about 70% of melanoma cases are not-associated with existing moles but form as new marks on the skin.
An unnoticed appearance of a new spot on your skin or a change in an existing mole are real problems that should be dealt with.
And therefore it is recommended by many experts to get to know your skin and keep an eye out for any change. It may also be a good idea to go through a few skin cancer pictures to get an idea of what different types of skin cancer might look like. If you spot anything suspicious the best thing you as a person can do is to see your doctor as soon as possible.
Remembering all of your skin’s appearance and remembering to follow up on your own skin examinations on a regular basis is not easy though and this is where Miiskin’s solution comes in.

About the Miiskin App
The Miiskin app helps you structure a process around your skin examinations and allows you to take and keep photos of your skin and moles for monitoring over time. It also assists you in comparing photographs over time by allowing side-by-side viewing and parallel manipulation of the images. This makes it far easier for the user to identify differences between photos such as the appearance of a new mole, or a change to an existing atypical mole. We are now also working on an innovative new Skin Mapping solution, where a computer also highlights all the moles and marks it can find to visually aid the user.
monitor your moles with miiskin app
When we tell consumers about our feature set, they are often surprised by the simplicity – For most people it is tempting to think that it must be easy to risk assess a mole or do something clever with the photos taken with the app, but unfortunately it is far from simple to diagnose melanoma.
When we tell doctors and those people, who have been living with the challenge of keeping an eye on their skin, the simplicity of the Miiskin app is much welcomed. Knowing about the complexity, they realise that enabling an important behaviour can be a game changer in this space
Skin self-examinations have been championed by experts over the last 30 years. And with the cost of taking a photo dropping to zero with the emergence of smartphones, photographing your skin and moles are recommended by more and more organisations.
skin mapping
British Skin Foundation, CANSA, Melanoma Institute Australia, Danish Dermatological Society, Queensland Department of Health, WebMD and UpToDate. This is just some of the organisations recommending taking photos, not as a panacea to the problem, but in order to make progress in the right direction.
And it seems Miiskin is in a perfect position to bridge the recommendations with what the skin-smart consumers want: simplicity, security, convenience and a small nudge now and then to stick with it.
Miiskin is made with love in Copenhagen. Miiskin’s apps have so far been downloaded over a quarter of a million times and they are very highly rated in the app stores. Miiskin’s users have taken a quarter of a million photos in the effort of keeping an eye on their skin.",,

Enhanced surgery experiences and outcomes
At Buddy Healthcare, we help our customers drive a 5-star patient experience. Our dedicated team works day-in and day-out to transform pre- and post-surgical care together with our customers. We want to solve the most significant problems hospitals, clinics and patients are facing in surgeries: patient adherence to treatment, late cancellations and no-shows, administrative work and care quality. 

Care personnel doesn’t know how their patients are doing before, and after surgeries, they don’t have tools to monitor patients and receive up-to-date health information, and they spend an extensive amount of time on communications and paperwork. Vice versa, patients don’t want to be any more bystanders in their own treatment. They want to participate in decision-making actively, receive easy-to-follow timely instructions and support and always know what will happen next in their care path.

The origins of Cuidum
Cuidum is the project of 3 entrepreneurs convinced that another way of aging is possible that they have been adding people to their cause from 2015 to today.

It all starts at an event for young entrepreneurs. Juanjo, Nurse and Physiotherapist, master's degree in aging and with experience in nursing homes, proposed to Jorge and Pablo, with extensive experience in the Internet and in business respectively, to spend an intense weekend studying the reasons that lead families to take out from their homes to their elders and to seek innovative solutions. They analyzed models in other countries and decided that it was the project to which they were going to dedicate all their energy. There the seed of Cuidum was sown, with the ambition of providing dependents with all the necessary resources so that they could remain in their homes.",,

You got this!
Switching to Femalecup might sound a bit scary at first and like all new relationships it may take a little time to get completely comfortable with each other. But from personal experience, it’s a small change that once you get used to it, you will wonder why you didn’t do it earlier. It’s an absolute game changer and a new bestie while on our period!

What is a Femalecup, exactly?
The short version: Femalecup is 12 hours of dancing, working, swimming, sleeping (if you sleep so long!) running, going out etc. It's no more sleepy-pants and no more worries. It keeps you dry, safe and carefree all day and all night long. It is a solid goodbye to those the monthly supermarket trips shopping for pads or tampons (can we get an AMEN sister) that are going straight into the bin and constantly reminding you about your period while being well… not so sustainable for the environment.

What is Femalecup made from?
The Femalecup is a silicon menstrual cup that collects your menstruation instead of absorbing it. It is made from a 100% medical-grade silicone, making it the safest most sanitary product to use while on your period. The cup does not contain any additives that may harm your body, as tampons and pads do. The Femalecup is in fact antibacterial on its own, due to the surface of silicone. Tampons and pads, on the other hand, can cause a bacterial infection and misbalance the natural pH levels in your vagina. 

Using Femalecup is a game changer for you, your period and a it’s big plus for the environment. It’ all you need. So babe, there is only one last thing to say - May the cup be with you 💫",,

OUR STORY
Whilst completing her masters degree in Bioinformatics, Sofia started studying the Human Microbiome in a course at Copenhagen University. Her interest in the subject had already begun a couple years prior, when she read Dr. Martin Blaser's book 'Missing Microbes.' Who knew we had that many microbes? And that they could change how good you feel, or how good you look?!

Doctor's orders demanded she take antibiotics during her teens and now, with this new information, she had to wonder - how much damage was done to my microbes? How did those prescriptions affect my health and wellbeing today?

She wanted to test her own gut. Unfortunately, there was nothing local that allowed her to test her microbiome, and find out how her gut was doing.

Lo and behold, GUTXY was born!

The reason is that the lymph node is the first site where metastasizing cancer cells will occur. We have now discovered a limited number of biomarkers that, when analyzed together, identify cancer cells in the lymph node and grade cancer cell aggressiveness i.e. their propensity to metastasize to distant sites.

THE SCIENCE

 

The phrase ""the science of happiness"" refers to a new field of social science called positive psychology. Contrary to popular belief, it is not ""positive thinking"" or self-help, but a broad empirical field of research and application worldwide. While traditional psychology is mitigative -- helping us get less of what we don't want and fix the things that are wrong with us -- positive psychology functions constructively in helping us get more of what we do want, and making ourselves better, happier people.",,

Hello Ruby is the world’s most whimsical way to learn about technology, computing and coding. We are all about curiosity, playfulness and logic.

We provide tools for kids, parents and educators to learn to understand programming in a fun and creative way. Our story started off with a book that is now published in over 22 languages, including Japanese, Korean, Dutch and even Finnish.

The book made its debut on Kickstarter in 2014 and quickly smashed its $10,000 funding goal after just 3.5 hours and gathering 380 000 dollars in total funding. Hello Ruby was at the time the most funded book on Kickstarter's children's book category. In a more and more technical world we need to make STE(A)M education more approachable, more colourful and more diverse.

Our aim is to create, promote and evaluate exceptional educational content on computational thinking for 4 -to 10-year-old children across different channels. These include things like the ability to decompose a problem, spot patterns, think algorithmically, debug problems and work together. Ruby’s story continues online with exercises. We are also working on a series of small apps on computational thinking.

Hello Ruby: Adventures in Coding has been published in over 24 languages.
The new approach to teach technology has been well received especially in Asia. The Japanese edition of Ruby was the most sold children’s book on Amazon and Rakuten for a week and won the biggest design award in China, DIA Design Award.
Linda’s TEDx talk in CERN on children and computing has been watched over 1.5 million times. Linda Liukas

Having tested the concept in Cornwall they moved the operation to London in early 2017 and began looking for funding. In July 2017 they were awarded one of ten places on the Rainmaker Foundation accelerator for charitable ventures with outstanding potential.

Having secured seed funds in the summer of 2017, work on the booking platform began in November of that year and the charity was officially incorporated a month later. The first automated pilot took place from February to May 2018 with more than a hundred caregivers enjoying breaks in hotels and holiday cottages from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland. The following pilot from January to May 2019 saw a 300% increase in beneficiary reach, enabling hundreds of caregivers to access breaks throughout the UK.

In 2019, Carefree was awarded multi-year funding by the National Lottery Community Fund and won Breakthrough of the Year at the Third Sector Awards. The charity was also selected as a best practice example by the Social Care Institute for Excellence and awarded a place on the Social Tech Trust ‘Tech To Unite Us’ programme.

,https://extendfertility.com/,Rainmaking,5,"Extend Fertility was founded on the premise that democratizing egg freezing could ultimately change the fertility industry and deliver better results.  Our co-founder, Dr. Joshua Klein, was a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at one of the nation’s leading fertility practices.  However, he observed that IVF’s low success rate for women over 40 and its high cost was disappointing for doctors and patients alike.  Dr. Klein saw the opportunity to help women think more proactively about their fertility. He believed that if more women could access their younger eggs during the IVF process, more women would see successful outcomes.

Since our founding, we have helped thousands of patients on their fertility journey through egg freezing and IVF – putting them in charge of their fertility future instead of letting time dictate the path. Extend Fertility began offering egg freezing at 40% below the national average cost. By 2017, we were the largest egg freezing practice in the nation. Since then, we have expanded to offer a full range of infertility services, including IVF, in a small practice environment that is more personal, higher quality and data driven.

We believe that no one should fear what they don’t know about their own fertility. We share a passion for delivering fertility in a more caring and transparent way.  Because ultimately, what we do every day has the potential to change lives.",,

In 2019 they were followed by three other universities, and now pave the way for other ambitious universities, business schools, and learning institutions across the globe by bridging the gap between “the knowing and the doing” within sustainability.

Assessment Criteria
To determine whether or not a solution is qualified to claim a spot on Global Opportunity Explorer, we use six assessment criteria: 

1. Readily available
Global Opportunity Explorer solutions must be more than just vague ideas or blueprints. Candidates must be or have concrete projects that are making an impact in societies and markets. They must be readily available products or services, meaning they have already done something before and are able to do that same thing again.

2. Commercially viable
Financial sustainability of projects is a key quality for solutions, which should not completely rely on a funding or donation-based business model.

3. Positive environmental impact
Global Opportunity Explorer solutions must have a direct positive impact on climatic or environmental factors, at some scale. There can be challenges and trade offs associated with all companies but overall it must be deemed the solution has a net positive benefit.

4. Improve quality of life
Global Opportunity Explorer solutions are assessed on their ability to deliver a better and more sustainable life for the people impacted by the solution. Solutions should enhance well-being either at an individual or societal level.

5. Innovative
Global Opportunity Explorer solutions should have a certain je ne sais quoi – they should provoke excitement and intrigue through their uniqueness or innovative nature. Innovation is a notoriously difficult property to measure and it is rare to find a product or service that is truly unique, but solutions that offer a product or service that is common-place may not be featured on the Global Opportunity Explorer.

6. Other exclusion criteria

We started Modern Fertility because we heard a lot of buzz (and panic) about fertility—but we had no idea how it applied to us. As women not yet ready for kids, were we supposed to be worried?

Planners by nature—we don’t like not knowing what we don’t know. So we dug in.

We found that you can go to a fertility clinic and take simple blood tests to check in on where you stand. But not everyone can afford them and the results can be tricky to decipher. We use information to get smart about everything in our lives—relationships, money, school. Why is something as formative as fertility still a black box?

So we went to work building Modern Fertility. An easy way for every woman to get the info she needs to make decisions about her fertility.

There’s a ton you can do in regard to fertility these days—but we think that information is the best first step.

Usafi Sanitation was established through passion and over 10 years’ experience in the Sanitation Industry.

Our business is driven by bringing elegantly designed, affordable and innovative sanitation solutions that are ideal for people who have no access to sewer systems.

We work with schools and institution, resorts/lodges, outdoor event organizers, construction sites, people with remote homes or offices, camping sites and NGOs disaster sanitation management.

The Problem
Did you know that half the world’s population live with no clean, safe or private place to go to the toilet?
According to the UN, 443 million school days are lost every year due to sanitation and water related issues.
Inadequate school sanitation facilities are a common barrier to school attendance, especially for girls. It thwarts the right to dignity especially for sick and elderly people when sanitation facilities are not available nearby.
Many schools in Kenya have more than 100 pupils per latrine as compared to the recommended maximum of 30; and few schools have access to safe water for drinking and washing hands.
Kenya: 86.9% had separate latrines for girls, boys and school personnel.
Kenya: Less than a quarter of the schools met the country standards for either the number of latrines for boys (20.1%) or for girls (19.0%).
Kenya; Out of schools that were surveyed to determine whether or not they had child-friendly latrines, 62.4% met the criteria for spacious cubicles, 51.3% for an appropriate aperture and 75.8% met the criteria for privacy.
Kenya; Only 32 schools (9.3%) met the minimum hygiene criteria.
Kenya; Just over a quarter (27.1%) of schools were found to maintain their latrines correctly.
 

The Solution
Constructing pit latrines can be expensive and sometimes not practical for those without access to sewer system.

Installing a WaterLess Composite Toilet is an affordable one time off capital investment made to sustain heavy weight and last for decades.

These toilet solutions do not require power, chemicals or water amounting in huge savings on recurring bills.

The Waterless Toilets offer an affordable yet elegant alternative to conventional sewer, septic systems or pit latrines for people in remote areas or areas unserved by a sewer system.

They are odour-free, chemical-free and completely waterless using a hygienic aerobic process to treat human and recycle human waste. They are ideal for schools & institutions, rural homes, remote offices, construction sites, recreation centres, camping sites, outdoor events and post-disaster Sanitation.

Our range of sanitation includes;
Commercial Waterless Toilet Solutions
Domestic Waterless Toilet Solutions
Budget Waterless Toilet Solutions

One billion thirsty
According to the UN's research, one billion people on Earth doesn't have access to medically safe drinking water. Only 2,5% of water is drinkable. Almost 10% of all the world's diseases would not even exist if water supply, sanitary conditions, and hygiene were improved, and if water resource management was on a higher level. That would, in return, also lower child mortality rates, improve human health and food status in a sustainable way.

Two trucks of plastic end up in oceans every minute
Plastic is a material that the Earth cannot degrade, which represents a large environmental problem. Huge plastic islands that systematically destroy all wildlife are formed in the oceans, which undoubtedly affects human health, too. We can recycle plastics the proper way, but we can also switch to using glass, the most natural material for water preservation that is also 100% recyclable.

Croatia is third in the EU for its abundance of water

In practice, how this is works is that for every bottle sold, we donate directly to our NGO partners in Africa to install pumps in rural communities.

No middlemen or organisations. 

We take 20% off our revenue and give it to the people who need it most.

If you’re a details kind of person, here’s what our donation model looks like:

The Dream
Five years ago, getting a six-pack was all I could think about. It was my dream and I went after it like a seagull on a chip. As well as working out more and increasing my daily calorie intake, my water consumption also went up. But when it came to finding places where I could get free tap water, I was stumped.

After being refused refills by countless cafes and restaurants, I remembered my dad’s stories of growing up in Ghana with little or no access to clean water.

And that's where my dream took a different direction.

I realised I could save cash, hit my fitness goals, and take care of the planet - all by selling bottles to provide clean water to communities in Africa. I sourced my first prototypes, started recruiting all the tap water friendly, free refill cafes, shops and restaurants and then added them to a map.

That's how GiveMeTap and The Water Network came to be.

What started out as a six month six pack challenge transformed into an epic journey and commitment to solving the global water crisis, one bottle at a time*.",,

SolarSack is a Danish based impact start-up. Our mission is to bring safe and affordable drinking water to the 2.2 billion people in the world who currently lack access to clean water.
Our Story
The first SolarSack was developed on a research trip to the Adjumani refugee camp in Uganda, 2017. Our founder, Alexander Locke, submitted the solution as part of his Master’s thesis in Industrial Design Engineering. While spending time in the refugee camp, it was clear to him that the area struggled with deforestation as the residents were forced to cut down trees in order to boil water.

This sparked an idea to develop an alternative to boiling water that would not negatively impact the environment while still providing safe and clean drinking water. After several workshops with local residents, Alexander was able to prototype an improvement to the Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) method in a multi-layered plastic bag composition that allowed purification using only the sun rays.

This was the invention of SolarSack.

The Impact
SolarSack actively contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2030.

Good Health and Well-being - SDG 3 and SDG 6

By providing an affordable water purifying solution, SolarSack offers accessibility to low-income communities that are severely impacted by water-borne diseases. This has a direct impact on the social and economic development of small households such as lost income due to sick days and healthcare expenditure while also increasing children’s school attendance and improved health.

Environment - SDG 13 and SDG 15

Boiling water using wood fuel contributes to millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions globally. Implementing the SolarSack reduces end-user dependency on fossil fuel as well as deforestation and CO2 emissions. SolarSack can be reused 500 times and saves more than 500 kg in CO2 emission during its lifetime - at scale this can have a dramatic potential to mitigate climate change.",,

Secure        Affordable        Sustainable
Bigpot is developing commercial and technical innovations to create local community energy markets where energy will be traded amongst residents over a blockchain based platform, guaranteeing 24/7 supply of electricity.
Bigpot provides intelligent monitoring, control and sharing of electricity through blockchain-based software and the advanced power systems technology.

About Bigpot
At Bigpot, the overarching mission is to relentlessly shoot for an Africa with secure, affordable and sustainable energy.

Of the 2.4 billion additional people expected to be added to this planet by 2050, 1.3 billion will be added in Africa. Couple this figures with a rapidly urbanising and developing Africa, the result is an explosive growth in the demand for energy.  In other words, Africa's already challenging energy situation is bound to get much worse- if we fail to act. At Bigpot, we are determined to play a role in solving this energy crisis. We believe there are three intertwined focal points to this energy problem- affordability, security and sustainability.  

Energy Security: Bigpot seeks to play a role in concert with other relevant organisations to ensure that the resources that Africa needs to produce clean and sustainable energy are secure. Long term security of energy supply requires steady investment of attention and finances from both public and private sector stakeholders. Historically, African countries have depended on fossil fuels to produce energy. This is an insecure system because of the political volatiltiy and finite nature of such space. African countries must pursue more secure resources, reinforcing their ability to keep the light on for everyone in the long term. 

Energy Affordability: At Bigpot, the belief is that right to affordable energy for the African is a fundamental right. Access to energy for homes and businesses is a key component of industrial growth which in turn is central to the much needed economic growth on the continent. To this effect, Bigpot will continually innovate and cooperate with other stakeholders  to drive down the cost of of energy services on the African continent. 

Energy Sustainability: Bigpot will only pursue solutions which help to move Africa towards a future where sustainable energy is the norm. The impact of relying on fossil fuel cannot be overstated, the underlying effects ranging from adverse health to the unfavourable climate change. Fortunately, Africa is blessed with enormous renewable resources which can be exploited to this end. Furthermore, because Africa's energy infrastructure isn't yet fully developed, there is an opportunity to leapfrog directly to clean energy without the head ache of dealing with a redundant fossil fuel infrastructure. At Bigpot, we will work with other stakeholders to seize this vital opportunity. 

The first step of this journey is the development of smart energy share systems. These systems facilitate the sharing of diesel generator among co-located residences and business, translating into more efficient (lower greenhouse emission and lower fuel usage per kWh of electricity generated) use of the generators. These smart energy systems are renewable energy ready. In essence, they are a bridge technology aimed at the total phase-out of fossil fuel generator use on the planet.",,

Direct Air Capture is a technology that captures carbon dioxide directly from the air with an engineered, mechanical system.
Our Direct Air Capture technology does this by pulling in atmospheric air, then through a series of chemical reactions, extracts the carbon dioxide (CO2) from it while returning the rest of the air to the environment. This is what plants and trees do every day as they photosynthesize, except Direct Air Capture technology does it much faster, with a smaller land footprint, and delivers the carbon dioxide in a pure, compressed form that can then be stored underground or reused.

IRECT AIR CAPTURE
Carbon Engineering's Direct Air Capture technology removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.
Unlike capturing emissions from industrial flue stacks, our technology captures carbon dioxide (CO2) – the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change – directly out of the air around us. This can help counteract today’s CO2 emissions, and remove the large quantities of CO2 emitted in the past that remains trapped in our atmosphere.

From our pilot facility in Squamish, Canada, we have fully demonstrated our Direct Air Capture technology and are now commercializing. Our team and partners are working to build industrial-scale Direct Air Capture facilities that will each capture one million tons of CO2 per year – which is equivalent to the work of 40 million trees.

Direct Air Capture can help the world decarbonize and achieve critical net zero targets by producing clean transportation fuels, and large-scale carbon removal.
To restore a healthy balance of carbon in the air and maintain a safe climate, we must reduce the amount of carbon we emit each day, and also remove excess carbon from the atmosphere to get us back to safe levels. Direct Air Capture can play both of these roles. It can be used to prevent new CO2 emissions, and also, to permanently remove excess CO2—making it a powerful ingredient in any net zero plan.

Reducing Emissions: CO2 captured from the air can be used to produce synthetic fuels that have little or no carbon footprint. These fuels can help reduce transportation emissions by directly replacing fossil fuels.

Removal of Emissions: Direct Air Capture can create permanent carbon removal, or negative emissions, when the captured atmospheric CO2 is permanently and safely stored deep underground.",,

Our most important partners are energy suppliers, installers and specialist wholesalers, whom we are happy to support for optimal solutions in their projects. 

The starting point for many electricity storage systems is the increase in self-consumption of a PV system. Of course this is a useful application. If, however, storage systems merely shift PV electricity behind the meter from day to night over their entire service life, it is not only the storage operator who forego savings potential, but ultimately the energy transition-friendly electricity storage system would work against the grid and the energy transition. Our storage facilities are therefore equipped to provide the best possible support for this joint project and thus generate additional savings and income for their owners. Even if you only start with the PV self-consumption increase,

Why we do what we do
Rapid population increases, rising global living standards and irreversible climate change are threatening Earth’s finite water resources.

The state of our water affects all natural, social and economic systems. If we continue to allow usable water resources to deplete at the current rate, by 2030 global water demand is going to surpass supply by 60%.

An increase in public awareness of water availability and contamination has led to regulatory and social pressures on industrial water users and utilities alike.

Water awareness is vital in business and often forms an influential part of an environmental strategy. An understanding of how water affects your business activities and how your business affects water supplies is an ongoing and iterative process. This knowledge can influence business decisions and subsequently manufacturing processes, making procedures not only more sustainable but also more cost-effective.

Global supply chains are complex and non-transparent leading to harmful effects on the environment, affecting the wellbeing of people and creating untold pollution. The products we use every day end up in the landfills and not one party can provide the necessary information to make positive choices about what to buy or how to produce in a circular fashion.

Circularise is developing an open-source protocol and decentralized network to bring transparency to global supply chains and move towards a circular economy.  We enable brands, suppliers, and manufacturers to choose healthy, sustainable, circular materials and present information about products and their supply chains in a transparent way without risking privacy.

eQ-3 company history

Headquarters in Leer, East Frisia
eQ-3 is one of the innovation and technology leaders in the smart home market and is particularly considered a pioneer in the home control sector. In 2019, for the fifth time in a row, eQ-3 was named European market leader * by the renowned Swedish market researcher Berg Insight.

With its own brands and OEM products, eQ-3 has a share of 40% of the installed base of all Whole Home systems in Europe. With more than 200 product types, the manufacturer also has the broadest portfolio in the smart home sector in the industry. To date, more than 2 million households have been equipped with over 36 million wireless solutions.

eQ-3: sister company of ELV

eQ-3 was founded in 2007 as a sister company of ELV Elektronik AG, a Europe-wide electronics mail order company and special interest publisher. The ELV / eQ-3 group of companies is 100% family-owned. As early as autumn 1979, ELV presented the first microprocessor-controlled timer with four separately switchable sockets. The group of companies can look back on 40 years of experience in the home control sector.

First steps in radio-controlled home automation

The FS20 radio control system was launched on the market in 2002 as an ELV product. This system ushered in the supremacy of the group of companies in radio-controlled home automation, which quickly became the standard system in Europe. The first wireless home control center followed in 2003.

Homematic conquers the market

With the spin-off of eQ-3 in 2007, the expertise in the home control area was bundled. The first generation of bidirectional house control conquered the market with the Homematic product line. This was programmed and controlled via the local control center CCU1. In 2013 the more powerful version of the control center followed: the CCU2. The product portfolio grew to over 90 Homematic devices for the smart home area. More and more enthusiastic users exchanged ideas in an online community about various possible uses and combinations of Homematic and shared their experiences.",,

Globally, more than 50% of the population lives in urban areas, and by 2045, this is estimated to increase by 1.5 times, to 6 billion. This unrivaled explosion in urbanization requires a paradigm shift from the current flow-through, linear phenomenon of resource inputs, processing, and its associated waste to a more cyclical structure that reduces resource consumption and waste production simultaneously.

Urban circularity, however, cannot exist without first achieving a sustainable water cycle, where residents have continuous access to safe clean water within the boundaries of their city. Via MNR technology, Biopolus has created a modular, expandable water treatment system for complex circular urban water treatment and management. By means of advanced metabolic engineering, energy, organic materials, and minerals can be derived from organic waste through biosolid fractionation. These solutions, along with optional space for community functions and urban food production are integrated and housed in the Biopolus BioMakery.

WATER-BASED URBAN CIRCULARITY
Biopolus created the BioMakery, an urban metabolic hub, to integrate circular urban infrastructure and technology with open innovation, helping cities transition from their current linear system of consumption and waste, to a sustainable and regenerative circular model. The BioMakery was created based upon the principle of water-based urban circularity, where energy, food, and waste systems are built around a regenerative and sustainable water cycle.

The BioMakery is a production platform that produces intermediary products from wastewater and organic waste. These intermediary products can then be further processed to a wide scale of valuable end products such as reuse water, food and feed, biopolymers, etc.",,

We strive to deliver the best quality coffee beans from the highlands of Ethiopia – the land from which the drink originates. Our beans are bought to Denmark directly from small-scale Ethiopian farmers using the minimum involvement of middlemen and no engagement of branch traders or agents. This way, we are 100% engaged with our coffee each step of the way.

More than just being a coffee company, we work to ensure long-lasting positive effects for the communities that grow the beans, creating projects which foster social development and create jobs in southern Ethiopia.

‘Since establishing the company in 2015, we have focused on redefining the coffee industry by strengthening the human and social values connected to it,’ explains Daniel Halala, the co-founder of Impact Roasters.

“Having grown up in the land of coffee itself, I soon realised that the quality of coffee available in Denmark needed to be improved. From this stemmed the idea of both satisfying the need for high-quality coffee in my new home country of Denmark, while also championing fair and sustainable business trade models in my birthplace, Ethiopia.”

Impact Roasters is proud to be running two specialty roastaries in Copenhagen, succesfull development projects in Ethiopia and a broad network of satisfied customers and followers worldwide.

,http://www.bemyeyes.com,Rainmaking,10,"Be My Eyes is a free mobile app with one main goal: to make the world more accessible for blind and low-vision people. The app connects blind and low-vision individuals with sighted volunteers and companies from all over the world through a live video call.

Since we launched in January 2015, more than 2,000,000 volunteers have signed up to assist blind and low-vision users. Be My Eyes users can request assistance in over 180 languages making the app the biggest online community for blind and low-vision people as well as one of the largest micro-volunteering platforms in the world! Every day, volunteers sign onto Be My Eyes to lend their sight to blind and low-vision individuals to tackle challenges and solve problems together.

The Be My Eyes story started in Denmark in 2012 with Hans Jørgen Wiberg, a Danish furniture craftsman, who is visually impaired himself. Through his work at ‘The Danish Association of the Blind’, he recognized that blind or low-vision people often needed a little assistance to solve everyday tasks. However, it wasn’t until a blind friend told him that he used video calls to connect with family and friends, who could help him with these tasks, that Hans Jørgen got the idea for Be My Eyes. He believed that the technology of video calls could be used to visually assist blind or low-vision individuals, without them having to rely on friends and family, but using a network of volunteers.

In April 2012, Hans Jørgen presented his idea at a Danish startup event, where he got connected with a team that was ready to make Be My Eyes a reality. On January 15th 2015, the Be My Eyes app was released for iOS, and within 24 hours the app had more than 10,000 users. Since the release of the iOS app, an Android version has been in high demand. The Android version was finally released on October 5th 2017. In December 2017 Be My Eyes was chosen as Google Play Best Apps of 2017 in the categories; “Most Innovative”, “Best Daily Helper” and “Best Hidden Gem”, and in May 2018 Be My Eyes won the Google Play Award 2018 for “Best Accessibility Award”.

,http://www.migrationlab.org/,Rainmaking,10,"Migrationlab was created at a time when migration was raising many debates and public anxiety in Europe, mainly due to negative political discourse and news in mainstream media, before even the refugee influx in 2015. However, authentic public discussions in which migrants, refugees and locals would share their own perspectives were non-existent. 

Migrationlab debuted as a blog in September 2014 showcasing Laura M. Pana's personal journey and reflections on being a Romanian migrant in Europe. At the time, the goal of the blog was to function as an online laboratory that generates wider authentic conversations and explores the notions of home, identity, mobility, multilingualism, gender equality together with migrants, refugees and locals all over the world. Having as starting point her own stories and encouraging in the process other people to share their own. 

As a result of positive feedbacks, three months later, the blog migrated to a project and ultimately to a non-profit organisation, Stichting Migrationlab, located in The Hague and Vienna.


Migrationlab took shape out of the need to co-create a dedicated physical space and time where migrants, refugees and locals reflect on who they are, where they come from and work together on how to live together in the same neighbourhood or city. Thus, generating new ways to communicate with and relate to each other in public space or at work.

This space reflects our incredible journey since 2014 and we hope it inspires you to take action in any way you can to foster diversity and inclusion in your own locality.

,https://www.lifeshelter.com/,Rainmaking,10,"Our mission
We want to transform the world's refugee camps into sustainable settlements.

We aim to be one of the world's leading suppliers of durable shelter solutions for humanitarian purposes.

Our History
Lifeshelter was founded in 2012 by Architectural Engineer Jakob Christensen and Architect Claus Heding. During the first four years we developed, tested, and optimized the durable panel-based shelter solution, which became the Lifeshelter. The development phase was finalized in May 2016.

It soon became evident, that although the product was very well-received, the price of a Lifeshelter was higher than the price of a tent, and well above the target price of the market. Therefore a partnership with Danish Refugee Council was established to investigate the possibility of producing the shelters locally at a lower cost. Changes in both material compositions and production methods revealed a great potential for both local production opportunities and lowering the price.

In August 2017 the locally producible shelter was finally launched, and it immediately received a lot of positive attention.

Our Inspiration
Arched vaults have been used throughout history as an optimized way of obtaining a stabilized structure. 6,000-years-old such vaults still stand in Nubia by the Nile.

During the 1990s a settlement of 500 houses inspired by this ancient tradition was built in Altiplano, Bolivia in a project led by Danish architect Lars Jørgen Jacobsen.

Lifeshelter has been greatly inspired by this project as well as the ancient tradition it draws upon, and the unique arched shape has proven to be an extremely stable and durable design.",,
